       "'South Africa recall Boje\\n\\nSouth Africa have recalled spinner Nicky Boje for the first Test against England, which begins on 17 December.\\n\\nBoje missed the recent tour of India because of fears he would be called in for questioning by Indian police over match-fixing allegations. Pace bowler Dale Steyn and opening batsmen AB de Villiers are new faces in a 13-man squad. Despite suffering poor form in India, new wicket-keeper Thami Tsolekile has been preferred to Mark Boucher. There is no place for opener Herschelle Gibbs, who has been struggling with a finger injury after missing the India trip, and spin all-rounder Justin Ontong has been dropped. Nicky Boje, who underwent minor surgery to remove a growth in his neck, will have to pass a fitness test before the match. Port Elizabeth, where the first Test is being held, is South Africa\\'s most spin-friendly venue.\\n\\nGraeme Smith (Capt), Nicky Boje, Hashim Amla, Zander de Bruyn, AB de Villiers, Boeta Dippenaar, Andrew Hall, Jacques Kallis, Makhaya Ntini, Shaun Pollock, Jacques Rudolph, Dale Steyn, Thami Tsolekile (Wkt).\\nFlintoff fit to bowl at Wanderers\\n\\nFourth Test, Wanderers: South Africa v England\\n\\nPlays starts Thursday, 0830 GMT\\n\\nThere had been concerns his rib muscle injury would restrict him to playing as a specialist batsman in the match. Captain Michael Vaughan said: \"He\\'s had a bowl and came out fine so he is fully fit to play as an all-rounder. \"We will see how he bowls. In Cape Town I thought he was our best bowler and in Durban probably our second best.\" Flintoff sent down around 20 deliveries at three-quarter pace during Wednesday\\'s practice session. The 27-year-old incurred a side strain during the 196-run defeat in Cape Townlast week and did not bowl again until the eve of the Johannesburg Test. Vaughan said he would not necessarily shield Flintoff from bowling the same heavy workload he endured in the first three Tests. The skipper commented: \"We will just have to judge who is bowling well on any given day and on the given surface to see how much we use him.\\n\\n\"But as a far as we\\'re concerned he is available to play any role required.\" Opening batsman Marcus Trescothick said the team remained confident despite the defeat in Cape Town which left the series evenly poised at 1-1 with two to play. He said: \"We\\'re allowed the odd blip here and there. You don\\'t win eight in a row without being something special. \"The guys are generally in good spirits, they needed the time off.\" With Flintoff happily fit to play and England thus likely to by unchanged, the form of pace spearhead Steve Harmison is the main concern. Trescothick said: \"Steve\\'s been fine throughout. [The ball\\'s] just not been coming out so well. \"Everyone goes through dips in form - it just depends how quickly people come back from those. But he\\'ll come back from that, we\\'re just waiting for it to happen.\\n\\nGraeme Smith (capt), Nicky Boje, Mark Boucher, Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers, Boeta Dippenaar, Herschelle Gibbs, Andrew Hall, Jacques Kallis, Charl Langeveldt, Makhaya Ntini, Shaun Pollock, Jacques Rudolph, Dale Steyn.\\n\\nMarcus Trescothick, Andrew Strauss, Robert Key, Michael Vaughan (capt), Graham Thorpe, Andrew Flintoff, Geraint Jones (wkt), Ashley Giles, Simon Jones, Matthew Hoggard, Steve Harmison.\\nECB reveals county one-day revamp\\n\\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board has announced major structural changes to two domestic one-day competitions\\n\\nBut the board has resisted calls to cut the number of four-day games, with the County Championship format unchanged. From 2006, the 50-over C&G Trophy will be divided into two conferences with Scotland and Ireland added. It will be played in the first half of the season, with an August final, while the Totesport League will occupy the end of the summer, in a 40-over format.\\n\\nHowever, the Scottish Saltires, who have finished bottom in two seasons in Division Two, will be removed from the competition after 2005. The nine teams in each Totesport League division will play each other just once - either home or away - with automatic two-up and two-down promotion and relegation spots. The third-placed team in Division Two will host the seventh-placed team in Division One in a one-off match to decide the final top-flight berth. An expansion of the Twenty20 Cup was already planned for 2005, and the ECB is to explore adding two further foreign teams in the future.\\n\\nFirst Class Forum chairman Mike Soper headed the working party responsible for the changes, after initial suggestions by the ECB were rejected by county bosses. \"I am extremely pleased with the outcome of this report which was unanimously acclaimed at the recent FCF meeting,\" he said. \"We will now have a strong competition in the C&G Trophy which reflects international cricket. \"Our highly successful Twenty20 competition will have a 40-over competition immediately following it.\" Following a model set in Australia and South Africa, the England A team will face touring sides each summer, either playing two first-class matches or a combination of four- and one-day games.\\nEngland duo hit centuries\\n\\nSecond Test, Durban, day three (close): England: 139 & 281-1 v South Africa 332\\n\\nBoth hit 132 - Strauss was unbeaten - as England finished day three 88 ahead on 281-1, having started it 163 behind. It was the 16th 200-run opening stand in England\\'s history, and by the time Trescothick was bowled by Shaun Pollock it was the country\\'s fifth best ever. Mark Butcher was Strauss\\'s partner at stumps in Durban, unbeaten on one. Trescothick bludgeoned 20 fours and two sixes in his 261-ball innings, with Strauss hitting 16 boundaries from 272 balls faced. It was the duo\\'s fourth stand of 150 or more and their best return in nine Tests together, bettering the 190 they shared against New Zealand at Lord\\'s this summer. In what had been a low-scoring game, England started the day on 30-0 and seemingly with a mountain to climb. But, allied to some loose bowling, the vagaries of the pitch which had hindered them on day one had disappeared to make life easier for England.\\n\\nThe first-wicket pair was circumspect in the opening 30 minutes of play, but soon feasted on the tripe served up by Dale Steyn, whose three-over spell cost 31 runs. The rookie paceman bowled short and wide, inviting Strauss to hook at will and Trescothick to take him for three successive boundaries through the off-side. The transformation of England - and indeed the pitch - was illustrated by their lunch score of 137-0, just two runs fewer than their entire first-innings effort. South Africa looked seriously bereft of options in the afternoon, with skipper Graeme Smith fruitlessly turning to himself, Steyn returning to the attack and Nicky Boje failing to threaten.\\n\\nPollock was the only one to bother England\\'s rampant openers, beating the outside edge of both batsmen. But there was to be no moving the batsmen as they rose through the ranks of England\\'s greatest first-wicket stands. England\\'s previous best in Durban - 160 by Wally Hammond and Bob Wyatt 73 years ago - fell away, and 31 runs later a new record for all teams at the ground was set. When the 200-run mark was passed, it was the first time England\\'s opening wicket had done so since Graeme Gooch and Mike Atherton against Australia in 1991.\\n\\nThe openers reached triple figures within moments of each other, Trescothick for the ninth time and Strauss for the fourth - and second in two Tests. Both carried on in the same vein after tea, with Trescothick hoicking Boje over mid-wicket for six and Strauss striking successive fours in the same over. South Africa\\'s only hope looked to be the new ball, and the dependable Pollock finally gave the hosts something to cheer when Trescothick edged a simple catch behind late on. Strauss, chanceless all day, next over gave South Africa a sniff when edging Ntini low down to second slip, where Martin van Jaarsveld spilled a tough one-handed chance. Bad light ceased play 11 overs ahead of schedule, and play will start 30 minutes early on day four.\\n\\nGraeme Smith (captain), Herschelle Gibbs, Jacques Rudolph, Jacques Kallis, Martin van Jaarsveld, Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers, Shaun Pollock, Nicky Boje, Makhaya Ntini, Dale Steyn.\\n\\nMarcus Trescothick, Andrew Strauss, Mark Butcher, Michael Vaughan (captain), Graham Thorpe, Andrew Flintoff, Geraint Jones, Ashley Giles, Matthew Hoggard, Simon Jones, Stephen Harmison.\\n\\nD Hair, S Taufel.\\nAustralia complete sweep\\n\\nThird Test, Sydney, day four (result): Australia 568 & 62-1 bt Pakistan 304 & 325\\n\\nPakistan, continuing on 67-1 overnight, posted 325 all out in their second innings and the home team quickly scored the 62 runs needed for victory. Asim Kamal top scored for the visitors with a well-made 87, but Australia were always in control after building a first-innings lead of 264. And on a turning wicket Shane Warne took 4-111 and Stuart MacGill 3-83. Australia took three wickets during the morning session to reduce Pakistan to 172-4, still 92 runs behind the home team\\'s first-innings total. It seemed at one point as though stubborn resistance would limit the visitors to the loss of Yasir Hameed during the first session of the day. But with lunch approaching the Australians swung the balance of the session in their favour with two wickets in two balls. Yousef Youhana was bowled by MacGill for 30 before Younis Khan was trapped lbw to Shane Watson to become the all-rounder\\'s first Test victim.\\n\\nAfter lunch Shahid Afridi was run out after a typically aggressive innings and his dimissal was sparked a fall of five wickets for 32 runs as the Pakistan lower order again threatened to capitulate. At one point they had been reduced to 270-9 after steadily losing wickets throughout the afternoon session. Shortly before the scheduled tea interval Australia claimed the extra half hour as they went in search of victory. But Asim Kamal, partnered by Mohammad Asif, who scored his first runs in Test cricket, put on 55 for the last wicket to set Australia a meagre target for victory. Jason Langer and Matthew Hayden wasted no time in setting about the victory target, thrashing a series of boundaries. With victory just four runs away Langer was bowled sweeping around his legs and new batsman Ricky Ponting smashed the next delivery to the boundary to seal victory.\\n\\nMatthew Hayden, Justin Langer, Ricky Ponting (capt), Damien Martyn, Michael Clarke, Shane Watson, Adam Gilchrist (wkt), Shane Warne, Jason Gillespie, Glenn McGrath, Stuart MacGill.\\n\\nSalman Butt, Imran Farhat, Yasir Hameed, Younis Khan,Yousuf Youhana (capt), Asim Kamal, Kamran Akmal (wkt), Mohammad AsifShoaib Akhtar, Naved-ul-Hasan, Danish Kaneria. Umpires: B Bowden (NZ), D Shepherd (Eng).\\nBoycott slams \\'chucking\\' plan\\n\\nGeoff Boycott has condemned the International Cricket Council\\'s proposal to relax rules on chucking.\\n\\nThe former England batsman said the move was made to benefit Sri Lanka spinner Muttiah Muralitharan, whose \"doosra\" ball could soon be legal. \"I think it\\'s been brought in through pressure from Sri Lanka and Murali\\'s supporters,\" Boycott told BBC Sport. \"It\\'s a sad day for cricket that this pressure can allow Muralitharan to bowl whatever he wants.\" A 15-degree flexing of the arm will be permitted following an extensive research programme conducted by biomechanics experts. Previously, only 10 degrees for fast bowlers and five degrees for spinners were permitted. Murali\\'s arm was measured at 14 degrees while bowling his \"doosra\" prior to the delivery\\'s banning.\\n\\nSri Lanka Cricket said such accusations were wide of the mark, and that the rule change would be made to benefit all bowlers. \"It is a bit unfair,\" a spokesman told BBC Sport. \"We have always said that many things need to be considered but we have never pressured the ICC and the decision is not only for Murali - it is for all.\" \"We are very happy about it as it means Murali will be able bowl his \\'doosra\\'. \"Sri Lanka Cricket appreciates it very much and we thank the ICC for making such a decision.\" The ICC Executive will be asked to ratify the recommendations made by a panel comprising Aravinda de Silva, Angus Fraser, Michael Holding, Tony Lewis, Tim May and the ICC\\'s own David Richardson. The panel met in Dubai and studied video evidence of bowlers as well as hearing the opinions of the three biomechanical experts.\\n\\n\"The scientific evidence is overwhelming,\" Holding said. \"When bowlers who to the naked eye look to have pure actions are thoroughly analysed with the sophisticated technology now in place, they are likely to be shown as straightening their arm by 11 and in some cases 12 degrees. \"Under a strict interpretation of the law, these players are breaking the rules. \"The game needs to deal with this reality and make its judgment as to how it accommodates this fact.\" De Silva tipped fellow Sri Lankan Murali, the second-highest Test wicket-taker with 532 victims, to raise the bar even higher. \"He has so much cricket left in him that I have little doubt that Murali will reach the 700-wicket mark in Test cricket,\" he said. \"The ICC has done the right thing and he can go ahead with his usual repertoire of bowling. \"I am glad for Murali, who will be a relieved man now.\"\\nEngland attempt to create history\\n\\nFirst Test, Port Elizabeth: South Africa v England\\n\\nMatch starts at 0830 GMT\\n\\nAfter whitewashes against New Zealand and West Indies, the tourists will attempt to put last week\\'s seven-wicket defeat by South A behind them. \"The guys are mentally aware of what\\'s required,\" coach Duncan Fletcher said. Mark Butcher is likely to pip Robert Key at number three while Simon Jones and James Anderson contest seam duties. The South Africans, who have dropped from second to sixth in the Test rankings in less than a year, are without spinner Nicky Boje. He is still recovering from surgery to remove a growth on his neck two weeks ago. Fast bowler Dale Steyn is poised to make his Test debut, but all-rounder Jacques Kallis is still troubled by an ankle injury and is expected to play as a batsman only. Opener AB de Villiers is also expected to make his debut, in place of the injured Herschelle Gibbs.\\n\\nEngland coach Duncan Fletcher has used his contacts in South Africa to study the new players and study flaws. \"Duncan lives in Cape Town and he has had his ear to ground about a lot of their players,\" said captain Michael Vaughan. \"With the amount of technology around these days you generally know quite a lot about the opposition. But video replay is not ideal and Vaughan warned: \"We don\\'t know how they\\'re going to react on the pitch.\" Home skipper Graeme Smith believes his team may have an advantage by being in action more recently than England, on a tour to India in November and December. \"The more cricket you play the more battle hardened you become, the more aware and better technically,\" he said. Smith feels England could have benefitted from an additional warm-up game, but will still provide a strong test for his team. \"We did the same thing (only one warm-up match) in Sri Lanka and paid the price in that series,\" he said. \"England, even though they lost the A game, come here with a lot of confidence and have some key performers. \"I really believe they have one of their strongest sides ever. The South Africans are certain to have plans to combat England\\'s most influential players, Andrew Flintoff and Steve Harmison.\\n\\nSmith said: \"Harmison, with his pace and height, has always had potential. \"He\\'s a confidence bowler and it\\'s important we put him under pressure.\" The Durham bowler was not at his best when the teams last met in England in 2003, taking nine wickets at 45.88 in four matches. Flintoff, by contrast, scored three fifties and a magnificent 142 and weighed in with 10 wickets, leaving Smith in no doubts about his capability. \"Freddie\\'s pulverised a few attacks but we\\'ve got a few ideas for him. \"I\\'m looking forward to him bringing out the best in our two all-rounders Kallis and Pollock.\"\\n\\nG Smith (captain), AB de Villiers, J Rudolph, J Kallis, H Amla, Z de Bruyn, A Hall, S Pollock, T Tsolekile, M Ntini, D Steyn, B Dippenaar.\\n\\nM Vaughan (captain), M Trescothick, A Strauss, M Butcher, R Key, G Thorpe, A Flintoff, G Jones, A Giles, S Jones, M Hoggard, S Harmison, J Anderson.\\nHarbhajan action given all-clear\\n\\nIndian spinner Harbhajan Singh\\'s bowling action has been cleared under new regulations introduced by the International Cricket Council.\\n\\nA bowler\\'s action is now deemed legal providing his arm straightens by no more than 15 degrees. An ICC statement said Harbhajan\\'s orthodox off-break and doosra now fell \"within the tolerance threshold\". He was reported to the ICC by match referee Chris Broad after a Test in Bangladesh last December. As a result, he underwent tests supervised by biomechanics expert Bruce Elliott of the University of Western Australia last month, who reported back to a panel of experts set up by the Indian board. They passed his findings on to the ICC, who will now circulated them to all members of the elite panel of umpires and match referees. Harbhajan, whose action first came under scrutiny in 1998, has taken 189 Test wickets and claimed 117 victims in one-day internationals. Elliott said he was confident he had bowled with a similar intensity to that of Test matches during the camera test. \"We can make a comparison to the video from the match when he was reported - things such as ball speed, arm rotation, position of the body and technique,\" he explained. \"We had two arbiters in Daryl Foster and Harbhajan himself to give a ranking to each delivery so that we were confident they were quality deliveries.\"\\nICC to press on with Dubai switch\\n\\nThe International Cricket Council is expected to confirm its move from London to Dubai with an announcement to be made later in January.\\n\\nBritish Sports Minister Richard Caborn met ICC president Ehsan Mani on Monday in an attempt to persuade cricket\\'s governing body against making the move. But the ICC remains keen to move to the United Arab Emirates to take advantage of tax breaks not on offer in Britain. Last December, the UK Treasury ruled out tax breaks for sports federations. The ICC is not impressed that it has taken so long for the British government to seek a meeting with Mani, especially as it had first mooted a move from Lord\\'s in June last year. Mani told Caborn that if circumstances had changed he would be prepared to consider asking his members to remain in London. But whatever the Department of Culture, Media and Sport can offer, the biggest factor for the ICC - tax breaks - remains something that only the Treasury can rule on. The ICC recently voted 11-1 with one abstention to move to Dubai, and now only the final details need to be arranged before everything is in place for the switch.\\nGanguly plays down fears\\n\\nIndia captain Sourav Ganguly has attempted to play down safety fears over their tour to Bangladesh.\\n\\nThe Indian squad arrived in Dhaka on Wednesday for a 19-day tour featuring two Tests and three one-day matches. The first Test has already been put back a day to Friday after the Indian embassy received threats purporting to come from Islamic militants. \"Security is an important factor but we as a team are concentrating on cricket and nothing else,\" Ganguly insisted. A hand-written fax allegedly sent by the Harkat-ul-Zihad group threatened to kill Indian cricketers, but has been dismissed as a hoax by the Bangladesh authorities. They are suspected of carrying out the assasination of poet Shamsur Rahman six years ago. The group\\'s hostility towards India stems from riots in the western state of Gujarat in 2002, which left 2,000 people dead, many of them muslims. The Board of Control for Cricket in India is leaving nothing to chance and are sending security experts to assess the situation in Chittagong, where the second Test is due to start on 16 December.\\n\\nDespite Bangladesh\\'s mediocre record of 29 defeats in 32 matches at Test level since 2000, Ganguly said his team would take nothing for granted. \"I don\\'t think Bangladesh are pushovers. I always respect the opposition and Bangladesh are no exception. \"I don\\'t think any side has has gone and played in Bangladesh with a sense of complacency.\" India were Bangladesh\\'s first Test opponents four years ago, winning by nine wickets in Dhaka despite the home side making 400 in their first innings.\\nPakistan \\'to host next Asia Cup\\'\\n\\nPakistan are to host their first Asia Cup one-day tournament next March, according to Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan.\\n\\nKhan told the Reuters agency a decision had been made at Monday\\'s meeting of the Asian Cricket Council in Dubai. He said India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have all confirmed their participation, and that qualifiers would also feature. Six teams, including Hong Kong, played in the eighth Asia Cup, in Sri Lanka last year, the hosts triumphing. Pakistan has not hosted any of the previous tournaments, dating back to 1984 because of poor diplomatic relations with neighbours India.\\nHolding slams Twenty20 \\'rubbish\\'\\n\\nWest Indies great Michael Holding has branded Twenty20 cricket \"rubbish\" as its international future is debated.\\n\\nHolding refused to watch last month\\'s Twenty20 match between Australia A and Pakistan in Adelaide. He told The Voice: \"It saddens me to hear people say that it is a real contest between bat and ball. How can simple slogging be good cricket? \"It might have a place in domestic cricket but should never be introduced as an international competition.\"\\n\\nThe International Cricket Council chief executives\\' committee is to discuss the new format, which has proved a massive success at domestic level, in Melbourne on Friday. Twenty20 cricket, which features games lasting less that three hours, was first launched in county cricket in 2002. It has since taken off domestically in South Africa, and Australia are planning a state competition next January. New Zealand will stage the first men\\'s international against Australia next month, and the Aussies are to play England at the Rose Bowl in June. However, Holding has told his television employers he does not want to commentate on the shortened game. \"What is the point of telling youngsters to watch the game but not to copy the players\\' techniques?\" he continued. \"There is nothing good about Twenty20 cricket. People who disagree don\\'t know what they are talking about.\"\\nAustralia build imposing lead\\n\\nThird Test, Nagpur, day three (stumps): \\nAustralia 202-3 & 398 v India 185\\n\\nIndia were bowled out for just 185 in the morning session, with paceman Gillespie returning 5-56 - his eighth five-wicket haul in Test cricket. Katich then made 99 as the Aussies established an intimidating 415-run lead in reaching 202-3 at stumps. It places Australia on the brink of a first series win in India for 35 years. Murali Kartik showed some spirit with two wickets in the evening, but with Damien Martyn (41) and Michael Clarke (10) at the crease and batting still to come Australia look set to push on come Friday. India\\'s tail fared no better than the top order on Nagpur\\'s lively pitch, losing five wickets for 39 in the morning after resuming play on 146-5.\\n\\nEight balls into the day, Shane Warne claimed his 539th Test victim when fading one away from Parthiv Patel and taking the edge en route to slip. Skipper Adam Gilchrist delayed taking the new ball for a few overs, but was rewarded almost instantly when he did. Firstly, Gillespie gave Clarke the first of two catches at third slip to get rid of Agit Agarkar. And soon India\\'s last line of defence was dismantled when Glenn McGrath and first slip Warne combined to oust Kaif for 55 - a second successive Test match fifty. India were nine down when Kartik fell to Gillespie - one of eight to perish to catches off the edge of the bat - and all that remained was for the paceman to bag his first five-wicket haul against India with the dismissal of last man Zaheer. With plenty of time left in the Test and an opportunity to rest his attack presenting itself, Gilchrist chose not to enforce the follow-on despite Australia\\'s 213-run first-innings lead.\\n\\nThe early loss of Matthew Hayden aside - bowled during an excellent Zaheer Khan spell - it proved a sensible decision. It was largely one-way traffic once Australia had negotiated a tough, run-free 40-minute period after lunch, with Justin Langer surviving a couple of close lbw appeals to put on 80 for the second wicket with Katich. Langer\\'s scratchy stay came to an end just after tea when trying to hit Kartik out of the park but succeeding only in holing out at deep mid-wicket. Another meaningful partnership was in the offing, however, and Katich and the in-form Martyn upped the scoring rate in a deflating period for India. Katich was supreme against the spinners, playing patiently square of the wicket and using his feet to move into the 90s with sucessive on-driven boundaries off the hugely disappointing Anil Kumble (0-62). But fate - and Kartik - conspired against Katich, who stepped back in his crease and was plumb lbw to register the 74th score of 99 in Test cricket history. Martyn and Clarke were untroubled in the closing overs against a tiring attack, the latter announcing his arrival at the crease with two glorious boundaries in one Kumble over.\\nBatting prospects excite Vaughan\\n\\nEngland skipper Michael Vaughan is excited over a potential middle-order allegiance between Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen this summer.\\n\\nProvided Flintoff is fully recovered from an ankle operation, he and Pietersen may pose a big threat to Australia in the Ashes Test series. \"If those two get going there will be a need for helmets in the crowd,\" said Vaughan of the big-hitting duo. \"They\\'re destructive and can take the game to the opposition.\" Amazingly Flintoff is yet to play in a Test against Australia, but is progressing well in his recovery from the operation on his left ankle, having had the plaster cast surrounding the joint removed. The last few Ashes encounters have seen England decimated by injury, but Vaughan is hoping not to have this burden during the summer.\\n\\nPietersen\\'s three one-day centuries in South Africa recently have ushered him to the front of the queue for a batting place. But he would have to dislodge Rob Key and Mark Butcher from the waiting list, and Ian Bell has also staked a claim for a place. \"When you play Australia you need character and a bit of arrogance about you and Kevin has those attributes,\" Vaughan continued. \"But there is not only Kevin Pietersen available. \"We have options in the batting department and players are going to be disappointed. We would rather disappoint a few players than not have enough.\" England will be buoyed up by the 2-1 Test series victory in South Africa, but Vaughan is pragmatic enough to know that Australia are the benchmark by how his side will be judged. Vaughan added: \"It is a challenge I am really looking forward to because when you face the biggest challenges you have to relish it and I am sure the team will be thinking the same way.\"\\nHayden ruled out of Kiwi showdown\\n\\nThird one-day international, Brisbane: Australia v New Zealand\\n\\nMatch starts 0315 GMT Friday\\n\\nThe left-hander has failed to recover from a hamstring strain suffered in Sydney, when Australia won by 17 runs to level the series at 1-1. The Kiwis have added all-rounder Tama Canning to their squad as a replacement for veteran Chris Harris. The 27-year-old made three one-day appearances in Pakistan a year ago. He has been in good form with both bat and ball in domestic cricket, making his highest first-class score of 115 and taking eight wickets in the game as Auckland beat Northern Districts in the State Championship. New Zealand breathed a sigh of relief when Brendon McCullum and Scott Styris were cleared of code of conduct charges on Thursday.\\n\\nBut they will not finalise their line-up until shortly before the game because of persistent bad weather in Brisbane which forced Gabba groundsman Kev Mitchell to change the pitch to be used for the game. More rain is forecast for Friday, which could mean Duckworth-Lewis calculations having a big say in the outcome. \"We are keeping our options open and won\\'t be rushing to name our side until we are confident with the knowledge we have on the wicket we are going to play on,\" coach John Bracewell commented. They did well to run Australia close in Sydney after being reduced to 86-6, with Chris Cairns, Kyle Milss and Daniel Vettori showing the depth of their batting talent. \"I thought we showed considerable guts and determination,\" Bracewell added. Simon Katich is the likely replacement for Hayden in the Australian team, but they face a dilemma over who should open with Adam Gilchrist. Katich went in first in a one-day game against India at the start of the year but prefers the middle order and they could opt to promote Darren Lehmann instead. Lehmann has only opened four times in 110 limited overs internationals, but his last three scores in that role have been 92 not out, 50 not out and 119. The state of the pitch will also be a major factor in deciding the make-up of their attack. Michael Kasprowicz could return in place of spinner Brad Hogg as part of a four-pronged pace attack. But that would be tough on Hogg, who made 41 not out and took three wickets in the last match, and would also leave the hosts with a long tail.\\n\\nR Ponting (capt), A Gilchrist (wkt), D Martyn, D Lehmann, S Katich, M Clarke, A Symonds, B Hogg, B Lee, S Watson, J Gillespie, G McGrath, M Kasprowicz.\\n\\nS Fleming (capt), N Astle, M Sinclair, S Styris, H Marshall, C McMillan, J Oram, C Cairns, B McCullum (wkt), D Vettori, A Adams, T Canning, K Mills, I Butler.\\nDenness leads Luckhurst tributes\\n\\nFormer Kent and England skipper Mike Denness has paid tribute to former team-mate Brian Luckhurst following his death from cancer at the age of 66.\\n\\nLuckhurst, who became Kent president last year, played for the club between 1958 and 1976. His international career consisted of 21 Tests and he scored two hundreds to help Ray Illingworth\\'s England side win the Ashes in Australia in 1970-71. \"He was a great buddy and a loyal servant,\" Denness told BBC Sport. \"In cricketing terms, he probably didn\\'t have a lot of natural gifts, but with the gifts he had, he worked so hard at it that he deserved to reach the top which he did by opening the batting for England.\"\\n\\nKent chairman Carl Openshaw said Luckhurst had been \"loved, admired and respected\" by everyone at the club. \"Brian Luckhurst has been at the heart of Kent Cricket for the past 50 years, firstly as an outstanding player, then in a variety of administrative capacities and finally as an immensely popular president. \"Throughout that time, he was always caring, loyal and totally committed to Kent,\" he continued. Born in Sittingbourne, Luckhurst joined the staff at Canterbury at the age of 15 and during his first-class career made more than 22,000 first-class runs at an average of 38, including 48 centuries.\\n\\nHe was a member of the Kent team which dominated county cricket in the 1970s when they won nine trophies outright and also shared the County Championship in 1977. Luckhurst was 31 when his chance to play for England came along in a home series against a Rest of the World XI in 1970. He was named in the Ashes squad the following winter and marked his official Test debut, as Geoff Boycott\\'s opening partner, by scoring 74 and 20 not out in a draw against Australia in Brisbane. The following game in Perth saw him bat for almost six hours to score 131 and he also made 109 in the fifth Test at Melbourne as England took the series 2-0. \"It was a terrific performance and he, along with Geoff Boycott and John Edrich, were the three who scored all the runs. \"In one match, I think it was at Melbourne, he wouldn\\'t take his glove off at the break because he thought he had damaged a knuckle. In fact, he had fractured the knuckle but he got a hundred,\" said Denness.\\n\\nLuckhurst made an unbeaten 108 in his first Test on English soil against Pakistan and added another century against India later in the 1971 season. Although he appeared in three one-day internationals, his style was better suited to Test cricket, but he lost his place after the 1974-75 tour to Australia when the pace and ferocity of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson proved too much for England, who lost 4-1. \"It was a torrid time for all of us,\" added Denness, who was England captain on that tour. \"He was a great tourist, a great man to have [around] and a great performer. If you look at his Test record, it\\'s a very good record.\"\\n\\nAfter retiring from the Kent first team, Luckhurst captained the second XI before moving into coaching and later had a spell as a sports centre manager. In 1985, he made an unexpected return to action when Kent suddenly found themselves with only 10 players against the touring Australians. In recent years he worked in the club\\'s commercial department before taking on the presidency. But he was diagnosed with cancer in May 2004. \"Over the last 50 years I have faced many challenges - this is going to be the biggest,\" he said at the time. Luckhurst\\'s death was the third among the international cricket fraternity in the space of 24 hours following those of former West Indies batsman Allan Rae and ex-New Zealand wicket-keeper Ian Colquhoun.\\nEngland left in tatters in Durban\\n\\nTea, day one: England: 125-8\\n\\nGraham Thorpe was trapped lbw, Andrew Flintoff looped a catch to square-leg, Michael Vaughan fell plumb lbw and Geraint Jones hooked into the deep.

Mark Butcher then played on and Andrew Strauss was caught at mid-off for 25.\\n\\nPollock is given the task of capturing the final two England wickets.\\n\\nEngland 125-8\\n\\nAn authentic boundary next ball, lashed over cover for four more.\\n\\nNext ball Jones tries to duck a bouncer and the ball barely gets above stump height, glancing the top of his head and bringing four leg byes.\\n\\nJones stands up to Steyn and pushes through the gap at mid-off for two.\\n\\nBoje tosses one up from over the wicket and Jones has a dart at it, not finding the middle of the bat but smearing through a vacant mid-on for a single.\\n\\nAfter the pace barrage, Boje returns and Hoggard finds a single to leave new man Simon Jones on strike.\\n\\nThe Giles vigil ends in disappointing fashion as, severely hampered, he hooks at Steyn and the man at deep square-leg does not have to move.\\n\\nFavouring the back foot as Steyn continues to steam in, Hoggard is glad to see one of fullish length that he can push out for a single.\\n\\nAfter a single is scrambled, Hoggard moves into the firing line and just manages to avoid a rapidly rising bouncer.\\n\\nAnother part of unprotected Giles anatomy is battered at 85mph, Steyn\\'s skidding short one catching him in the armpit.\\n\\nHoggard jabs down at the final moment to keep out a yorker from Kallis that was destined for the timbers.\\n\\nAn appeal begun only by the keeper for caught behind against Giles down the legside increases a little in volume, but Darrel Hair is not impressed.\\n\\nHoggard does not know too much about a full and fast delivery, which he inside edges to fine-leg for a single.\\n\\n: Giles hooks uncomfortably again with one hand off the bat, but the single gives him temporary reprieve from the hostile Steyn.\\n\\nThe return of Kallis is warmly greeted by Giles, who clips a loosener neatly off his pads for four.\\n\\nMatthew Hoggard is the latest casualty, another short one from the aggressive Steyn thwacking into his arm guard.\\n\\nThe next ball is also short and Giles plays an unconvincing hook, with one hand coming off the bat, but some contact is made and Giles is grateful to stutter through for a single.\\n\\nGiles is thumped again by another short one.\\n\\nGiles ducks into a brutal low bouncer from Steyn, the ball crashes into his elbow and loops over the slip for four leg byes.\\n\\nSteyn returns for Pollock as South Africa look to wrap up the innings.\\n\\nThe hook proves to be the undoing of Jones, who picks out Rudolph in the deep off Ntini.\\n\\nJones edges low through a gap where fourth slip would have been, bringing four urgently needed runs for England.\\n\\nAnother hook goes high into the space in front of square, but determined fielding from Rudolph restricts Jones to two.\\n\\nPersisting with the hook shot, Jones is fully in control but can only get a single to deep square-leg off Pollock.\\n\\nJones hooks uppishly at Ntini and is within 10 yards of carrying to the fielder on the fine-leg boundary.\\n\\nAiming an expansive drive into the off-side he gets an inside edge and escapes with a single.\\n\\nJones pummels a cut shot off Pollock into the boards for his second four.\\n\\nVaughan is rapped on the pads bang in front by a skidding delivery from Ntini and umpire Taufel confirms his worst fears.\\n\\nPollock unsettles

delivery down the legside and easily turned for a single by Vaughan.\\n\\nGeraint Jones picks up a short one from Pollock and the ball soars over the ropes for the maximum to open the wicketkeeper\\'s account in emphatic fashion.\\n\\nVaughan rocks back to guide a forcing shot for a much needed boundary off Boje.\\n\\nFlintoff is beaten for pace by Pollock and his hook shot loops up tamely off the splice to square leg to leave his team in turmoil.\\n\\nVaughan appears to lose sight of a short one from Pollock, and having planned to leave it fends it awkwardly with the glove, before scrambling through for a risky single.\\n\\nVaughan is able to pinch a single as his gentle push on the off side defeats the fielder on the bounce.\\n\\nThorpe is trapped plumb in front by the metronomic Pollock.\\n\\nBoje resumes after the interval, Vaughan crashes one into Jacques Rudolph at silly point but slices the next ball through gully for four.\\n\\nEngland 58-3\\n\\nVaughan and Thorpe get through safely to lunch but know that much more will be required this afternoon.\\n\\nVaughan, badly needing to play a major innings, strikes a fluent boundary off Boje.\\n\\nKallis switches ends and produces a maiden as England look towards the safety of the luncheon interval.\\n\\nNew man Graham Thorpe clips a single from the final ball of the over.\\n\\nThe single proves effective as key man Strauss takes the strike and lofts a catch to extra cover, where Ntini swoops low to cap a fine morning for the home side.\\n\\nBoje finds some early spin with his third delivery and catches the edge of Vaughan\\'s bat as the England captain pushes forward, but De Villiers spills the chance and the ball falls to safety.\\n\\nKallis is replaced after two overs and the spin of Nicky Boje is tried 13 minutes before lunch.\\n\\nThere is nothing to stop a Strauss cut shot which brings up the England 50 in the 24th over.\\n\\nStrauss is denied a certain boundary when his pull shot strikes square-leg umpire Simon Taufel.\\n\\nKallis escapes with a maiden as a sumptuous looking drive from Vaughan goes straight to the ubiquitous Amla in the covers.\\n\\nStrauss strokes the next ball gloriously down the ground for his fourth boundary.\\n\\nVaughan pirouettes to pull Steyn stylishly but only for a single as the distinctive figure of Amla fields on the square-leg fence.\\n\\nStrauss eases the pressure a little by bisecting the field with a trademark drive to the boundary, as Kallis struggles to find his rhythm early on.\\n\\nJacques Kallis is introduced, having been unable to bowl in the first Test or in India, his first delivery is easily clipped into the legside for Vaughan\\'s first run.\\n\\nMore conviction in this pull shot from Strauss, and Steyn is dispatched to the boundary.\\n\\nJust a single from the over, a hook from Strauss, who moves to nine.\\n\\nMichael Vaughan is given a bouncer first up and survives an optimistic shout for lbw.\\n\\nAn inside edge onto the stumps off Steyn ends Butcher\\'s innings in disappointing fashion again.\\n\\nA nicely timed cover drive brings Butcher three runs, with the intrepid Amla cutting the ball off a yard inside the ropes.\\n\\nNtini replaces Pollock, who is left to fume in the outfield, his face a light shade of crimson.\\n\\nSteyn completes his second maiden, restricting Butcher with an accurate off-stump line.\\n\\nPollock hurls the ball back at Strauss and throws in a few choice words for good measure.\\n\\nThe extra bounce of Durban provides some uncertainty for Strauss, an attempted cut and hook bouncing too high for him.\\n\\nDale Steyn is brought into the attack and Herschelle Gibbs provides him with a maiden with an agile diving stop in the gully.\\n\\nButcher has to scamper through as he attempts a quick single to Amla, who is quicker than perhaps the left-hander gives him credit for, luckily for him the throw is a fraction high.\\n\\nAn elegant drive on the tips of his toes from Strauss through mid-off gives him his first boundary.\\n\\nMark Butcher nudges Ntini into the legside to open his account.\\n\\nPollock maintains the South Africa stranglehold with another over offering no easy runs.\\n\\nA stunning one-handed catch by De Villiers off an inside edge ends Trescothick\\'s bright innings.\\n\\nStrauss gets down to Ntini\\'s end and is happy to receive a ball on the pads which he clips neatly away through square-leg for three.\\n\\nTrescothick slashes a wide one from Ntini not quite out of the middle, but there is enough on it to clear Nicky Boje in the gully and race for four.\\n\\nStrauss looks for a single after driving to the right of Hashim Amla, but the fielder gets across well and ensures another maiden.\\n\\nThe wild Ntini produces a maiden, the final ball of the over keeping low and bouncing in front of wicketkeeper AB de Villiers.\\n\\nStrauss, keen to get off the mark, attempts a drive at Pollock outside off-stump but misses and it is another maiden.\\n\\nNtini asks the question of Darrell Hair but Trescothick is a long way forward, he clips the next ball off his pads for two more.\\n\\nAnother probing maiden from Pollock, with

But any bowler found to have an illegal action will be suspended immediately, shortening the current review process. \"This new process gives the game a sensible way forward,\" said ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed on Saturday. \"This issue has afflicted the game for over 60 years. \"Every time it comes up there are emotional reactions from people around the world based on fear and ignorance and I\\'ve no doubt we will see them all again this time.\"\\n\\nThe 15-degree limit follows an extensive research programme conducted by biomechanics experts. Previously, the levels were 10 degrees for fast bowlers and five degrees for spinners. The ICC ordered a review of its laws on throwing after several top international players, including Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralitharan, were reported for suspect actions. Muralitharan\\'s \"doosra\" leg-break delivery was found to involve a flexion of 14 degrees.\\n\\nAn expert panel comprising Aravinda de Silva, Angus Fraser, Michael Holding, Tony Lewis, Tim May and David Richardson found that most modern bowlers broke the rules in some way. But it added that the laws to determine whether their action was legal or otherwise were murky and unworkable. \"These recommendations have come from people who have played the game at the highest level and who have a deep appreciation of the issues,\" said ICC cricket committee chairman Sunil Gavaskar.\\nAustralia take control\\n\\nThird Test, Sydney, day three (close): Australia 568; Pakistan 304 & 67-1\\n\\nThey put on 153 for the fifth wicket before Gilchrist fell to spinner Danish Kaneria for 113, a 120-ball innings which included five sixes. Ponting was bowled by Naved-ul-Hasan soon after and Kaneria worked his way through the tail for figures of 7-188. Australia were all out for 568, a lead of 264, with Pakistan 67-1 at stumps. The home side were anxious to make up for lost time after rain prevented any play during the morning session. Ponting resumed on 155, but was content to play second fiddle to Gilchrist, who set about the bowling in his customary forthright manner. He passed 4,000 Test runs as Australia added 169 during the afternoon and reached his 13th century in spectacular style with two sixes off Mohammad Asif to reach 92 and then two successive fours off Shahid Afridi. His captain, meanwhile, registered the highest score by an Australian batsman at the Sydney Cricket Ground when he passed Greg Chappell\\'s 182 and was 196 not out at tea. He had lost Gilchrist by then, one of three stumping victims for Kamran Akmal, but newcomer Shane Watson looked solid in his first Test innings as they added 58. Ponting\\'s 200 arrived off 311 balls with a boundary off Naved, but the bowler gained his revenge when the Australian skipper chopped a ball into his stumps.\\n\\nHe is now one of only 13 batsmen in history to score four or more double centuries in Tests - and only the third Australian after Sir Don Bradman and Chappell. His departure heralded a rush of five wickets in nine overs with Watson caught for 31 off Kaneria, who ended the innings with the wicket of Shane Warne for 16. It was the third time the 24-year-old leg-spinner had taken seven wickets in a Test innings. Facing such a sizeable deficit, Pakistan needed a good start to their second innings and Yasir Hameed and Salman Butt began with a flurry of boundaries. They put on 46 in nine overs, but the introduction of spin led to Butt\\'s undoing as he flashed at a wide ball from Stuart MacGill and was caught at slip by Warne for 21. Hameed progressed to 40 not out off 46 balls, and new partner Younis Khan made five, before an offer of bad light from the umpires brought play to an end.\\n\\nMatthew Hayden, Justin Langer, Ricky Ponting (capt), Damien Martyn, Michael Clarke, Shane Watson, Adam Gilchrist (wkt), Shane Warne, Jason Gillespie, Glenn McGrath, Stuart MacGill.\\n\\nSalman Butt, Imran Farhat, Yasir Hameed, Younis Khan, Yousuf Youhana (capt), Asim Kamal, Kamran Akmal (wkt), Mohammad Asif Shoaib Akhtar, Naved-ul-Hasan, Danish Kaneria.

And he followed up with a wicket next ball before Bangladesh were bowled out for 184 in 58 overs in Dhaka. After the first session was lost to rain, Irfan Pathan took five wickets to reduce the hosts to 106-7 before Mohammad Ashraful dug in. Ashraful ended unbeaten on 60, having hit six fours and faced 135 balls. Kumble had a chance of a hat-trick after removing Tapash Baisya via a catch at first slip but Mashrafe Mortaza safely defended the fifth ball of his 12th over. But a run out ended the innings not long afterwards.\\n\\nIndia did not get chance to begin their reply as openers Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir were immediately offered the light on stepping to the wicket. India won the toss and Pathan soon got stuck into the top order, dismissing Javed Omar lbw in his second over with one that nipped back. Nafis Iqbal and Rajin Saleh were also ajudged lbw by umpire Jeremy Lloyds off consecutive balls in Pathan\\'s fifth over. Captain Habibul Bashar then pulled Zaheer Khan straight to square leg and when the same bowler had Khaled Mashud caught behind, Bangladesh were 50-5 after just 16 overs. Ashraful, largely in partnership with Rafique (47), did his best to build a recovery but India will expect to amass a huge lead on Saturday. Kumble is now fifth in the all-time list. Aged 34, he may still be able to reach the 500-mark, passed by only three men. Fellow leg-spinner Shane Warne tops the list with 552 wickets.\\n\\nHabibul Bashar (capt), Nafis Iqbal, Javed Omar, Mohammad Ashraful, Rajin Saleh, Khaled Mashud (wkt), Mushfiqur Rahman, Mohammad Rafique, Tapash Baisya, Mashrafe bin Mortaza, Manjurul Islam Rana.\\n\\nS Ganguly (capt), V Sehwag, G Gambhir, S Tendulkar, R Dravid, M Kaif, D Karthik (wkt), I Pathan, A Kumble, Harbhajan Singh, Z Khan.\\nTendulkar eyes Test return\\n\\nStar batsman Sachin Tendulkar is hopeful he will be fit for India\\'s home series against Pakistan next month.\\n\\nThe 31-year-old is poised to make his return from a long-term elbow injury on Tuesday in a domestic four-day match. \"I\\'m here to prepare myself in a particular way,\" said Tendulkar, who has not played competitively since the Bangladesh tour in December. \"I have to see how I go in the match. Nobody knows what\\'s going to happen but right now I feel fully fit.\" Tendulkar will captain West Zone against South Zone in the Duleep Trophy in Hyderabad. India paceman Irfan Pathan, who missed several domestic games this month due to a side strain, is also set to make his comeback in the same game. Tendulkar\\'s injury problems has been attributed mainly to wear and tear caused by non-stop cricket since he emerged on the international scene in 1989 as a 16-year-old. Pakistan arrive in Delhi on 28 February for their first tour to India in six years, which includes three Tests and six one-day games.\\nStreak happy with comeback\\n\\nHeath Streak was pleased with his performance on his Zimbabwe comeback, despite the defeat to South Africa.\\n\\nStreak made 68 bu the home side won the third and final one-day international by five wickets at Port Elizabeth. He said: \"I was nervous, especially because of the situation when I came in. The important thing was to chip in. \"I had to stay until the end and play each ball on merit. The important thing was to keep the ball on the ground and not play too many special shots.\" Thanks in the main to Streak, Zimbabwe recovered from 35-5 to post 206-8 in their 50 overs and then reduced the home side to 79-4.\\n\\nBut Justin Kemp, who was lucky not to be adjudged caught behind first ball, and was then dropped twice, smashed an unbeaten 78 to steer South Africa to victory. Nicky Boje, standing in as South Africa captain in Graeme Smith\\'s absence, praised the tourists, particularly Streak. \"We made it hard for ourselves but the Zimbabweans came back well,\" he said. \"Streaky is an old campaigner who knows how to play in those situations.\" Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu said: \"It was very important for us to fight hard and we\\'ll carry on fighting in the Test series.\" The first of two back-to-back Tests begins in Cape Town on Friday.\\nEngland eye win after Thorpe ton\\n\\nSecond Test, Durban, day four (close): England: 139 & 570-7d v South Africa 332 & 21-1\\n\\nThorpe shared in stands of 114 with Andrew Flintoff (60) and 132 with Geraint Jones (73) after England had lost three for 21 in the morning. The left-hander\\'s 16th Test ton came off 209 balls and included 15 fours. The hosts fell to 21-1 at stumps, with Matthew Hoggard trapping home skipper Graeme Smith lbw for five. To win, South Africa will have to break their own chasing record at the ground, which they set in 2002 when scoring 340 to beat Australia. On day three South Africa waited all day for a wicket, but three came along at once when play resumed on the fourth. Makhaya Ntini was the man to ignite the flame, tempting Andrew Strauss into a dalliance outside the off-stump which was pouched by Martin van Jaarsveld at third slip.\\n\\nThe prolific opener had added only four runs to his overnight 132 when departing. Ntini followed up with the wicket of Michael Vaughan, whose poor run continued when he was cramped up by a short ball and gloved behind for 10, taking his four-innings aggregate this series to 53. Shaun Pollock was doing a fine job tying up his end, and England soon fell to 314-4 when Jacques Kallis put an end to Mark Butcher\\'s painful 70-ball 13. It left the visitors\\' leading by just 121 with the middle-order exposed, but the lack of depth in South Africa\\'s attack gave England the chance to stabilise. With Graeme Smith forced to rely on support acts Dale Steyn (1-122) and Nicky Boje (1-163), England reasserted thanks to Thorpe and his partnerships with Flintoff and Jones. Flintoff, careful to avoid a pair of ducks, was indecisive early on, edging streakily for four and being struck on the shoulder in one Steyn over. But the all-rounder ended the first session with a full-blooded cover-drive that sent Steyn to the fence, and he carried on in similar vein after the interval. A six off Pollock over long-on was followed by two more off Ntini over square-leg, and Flintoff emulated Thorpe by reaching 50 with a boundary. South Africa\\'s only strike of the afternoon came when Smith offered a long-hop to Flintoff and enticed an edge, which AB de Villiers gloved behind the stumps. England\\'s scoring rate increased when Jones came to the crease, and he complemented Thorpe\\'s grafting approach with some abrasive strokeplay. The keeper blazed 73 off 82 balls, with 10 fours and two sixes, as England chased quick runs prior to the declaration, joining Thorpe in top-edging the hapless Steyn over the keeper\\'s head on numerous occasions. South Africa were forced to place a fielder at long-stop, but the runs continued to flow until Jones holed out at long-on to give Boje his sole strike. Ashley Giles, who will be fit to bowl in day five after suffering back spasms, came out to bat, but his swift removal by Steyn prompted the declaration.\\n\\nGraeme Smith (captain), Herschelle Gibbs, Jacques Rudolph, Jacques Kallis, Martin van Jaarsveld, Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers, Shaun Pollock, Nicky Boje, Makhaya Ntini, Dale Steyn.\\n\\nMarcus Trescothick, Andrew Strauss, Mark Butcher, Michael Vaughan (captain), Graham Thorpe, Andrew Flintoff, Geraint Jones, Ashley Giles, Matthew Hoggard, Simon Jones, Stephen Harmison.\\n\\nD Hair, S Taufel.\\nScotland closing in on new coach\\n\\nScotland cricket officials have announced that the team\\'s new coach will be named later this month.\\n\\nRecent press reports indicated that an original short-list of four had been reduced to two. Andy Moles, currently the Kenya coach, and South African Peter Kirsten are thought to be still in the running. But Cricket Scotland spokesman Roddy Smith declined to name names. \"It\\'s unfair as people are under contract to other people,\" he said. Moles is thought to have been the preferred choice all along after it was decided the coach\\'s role should be full-time. Previous incumbent Tony Judd chose not to apply for the permanent post because of a club commitment. Smith confirmed that interviews would take place in Edinburgh but would not confirm how many candidates there would be. Commenting on the Scottish newspaper reports he said: \"Press speculation has not helped.\"\\nBangladesh delighted at Test win\\n\\nBangladeshi players and fans celebrated after the side\\'s historic first Test victory, over Zimbabwe in Chittagong.\\n\\nThousands of fans, armed with drums and flags, ran into the streets in the capital Dhaka within minutes of the end of the game, halting traffic. \"It\\'s the best day in my life. I won\\'t forget the day I was a member of Bangladesh\\'s winning team. \"I don\\'t want to remember those hard days, I only want to think about the victory,\" said captain Habibul Bashar. Bangladesh President Iajuddin Ahmed, Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and opposition leader Sheikh Hasina have all congratulated the team. The win by 226 runs in Chittagong was Bangladesh\\'s first Test win at their 35th attempt since being granted Test status in 2000. Bangladesh managed three draws in their previous 34 matches - two of them against Zimbabwe and one against West Indies. Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore described the victory as \"a wonderful feeling\". \"You can see the joy and the relief of lots of other people,\" Whatmore told BBC World Service. \"We\\'ve taken our share of hammerings in the last year and a half and, putting this win in perspective, there\\'s probably a few more down the track. \"But I sense there\\'s a bit more self-belief when they come to play tougher opposition.\"\\n\\nWhatmore led Sri Lanka to victory in the 1996 World Cup and said this could not compare. But he continued: \"It was important for the whole country that the sport of cricket stand up and show that we\\'re progressing. \"There\\'s been a lot of frustration for a long time here in Bangladesh that the team is not pushing the opposition enough.\" The former Australia Test batsman played down the status of Zimbabwe, whose weakened side have just returned from a seven-month suspension of their Test status. \"Yes, our opponents are ranked pretty much near us at the moment so right from the outset that would suggest we had a chance of winning,\" he added. \"But to actually go out there and do it is another matter.\" Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu, who had made 92 in the first innings, but was dismissed for a duck in the second, was disappointed with the performance. \"There was some bad cricket on our side and good cricket by the Bangladeshis,\" he said. \"Our top order batsmen didn\\'t come to the party and we dropped about four to five catches.\" The second and final Test of the series against Zimbabwe begins on Friday in Dhaka.\\nSouth Africa crush Zimbabwe\\n\\nFirst one-day international, Johannesburg: South Africa 301-7 bt Zimbabwe 136 by 165 runs\\n\\nMakhaya Ntini and Andrew Hall took three wickets apiece as the tourists were bundled out for 136. Adam Bacher (56), Graeme Smith (50) and Jacques Rudolph (50) laid the basis for South Africa before Mark Boucher hit a rapid 49 in the home side\\'s 301-7. Poor bowling allowed the hosts to add 70 in the last five overs, although spinner Prosper Utseya took 3-40. South Africa went into the game looking to build on their recent 4-1 win over England but were without Shaun Pollock (ankle), Andre Nel (hamstring) and Jacques Kallis, who was rested ahead of the Tests. Zimbabwe, who gave a debut to teenager Sean Williams, chose to field first after skipper Tatenda Taibu won the toss. But they had to wait 16 overs for their first success as Smith and Bacher put on 87 for the first wicket. The breakthrough came when Smith was trapped lbw after missing a full toss from Stuart Matsikenyeri as he tried to swing the ball away to leg. Bacher\\'s fifty took 65 balls but he only faced eight more before holing out to Hamilton Masakadza off Utseya. Rudolph and Herschelle Gibbs put on 56 for the third wicket, but runs did not come freely as the spinners found purchase on a cracked surface. Utseya accounted for Rudolph in the 37th over and Justin Kemp quickly came and went after being easily stumped by Taibu. Gibbs was caught off Barney Rogers for 40 but Boucher punished the inexperienced Zimbabwe attack before being denied a half century by Elton Chigumbura. Albie Morkel then weighed in with 16 off six deliveries as the innings drew to a close. In reply, the Zimbabweans were rocked by a burst from new-ball pair Ntini and Hall, who reduced them to 55-4. It got worse when Morkel claimed two wickets in an over - and the match was effectively over.\\n\\nGC Smith (capt), AM Bacher, JA Rudolph, HH Gibbs, AG Prince, JM Kemp, MV Boucher (wkt), JA Morkel, N Boje, AJ Hall, M Ntini.\\n\\nT Taibu (capt, wkt), S Matsikenyeri, BG Rogers, H Masakadza, BRM Taylor, A Maregwede, E Chigumbura, SC Williams, P Utseya, T Panyangara, CB Mpofu.\\nAussies unhappy with pitch\\n\\nAustralian skipper Ricky Ponting was still able to raise a smile despite his side\\'s 13-run defeat by India in the fourth Test at Mumbai.\\n\\nThey had already done enough to win the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with victories at Bangalore and Nagpur, their first series success in India since 1969-70. \"I said I thought it would be one of the all-time great series and the first three Tests turned out that way. \"This was nowhere near a Test pitch. It was terribly disappointing.\" He was less than thrilled, however, with a pitch in Mumbai which saw 38 wickets fall on the second and third days to bring the match to an early resolution.\\n\\nAustralia only needed 107 in the final innings but were bowled out for 93 in just 30.5 overs as the Indian spinners made the most of conditions. \"It was definitely gettable, but I don\\'t think we played at our best with the bat today. \"Full credit to India though. They batted well in tough conditions and when the game was there to be won with the ball, they did what they had to do.\" Groundsman Polly Umrigar defended his pitch, saying: \"My verdict is that the batsmen did not apply themselves, \"The wicket was not as difficult as it is being made out to be. Batsmen willing to play shots got ample opportunities.\" Ponting also paid tribute to vice-captain Adam Gilchrist, who led the side in the first three Tests while he was recuperating from a broken thumb. \"When you look back through the series, everyone has contributed in one way or another. That\\'s a pleasing thing - it\\'s what you need in a good side,\" he added.\\n\\n\"It\\'s been a great tour. I\\'ve only been here a short time but we\\'ve certainly enjoyed ourselves - I think all of the players really enjoy touring India. \"It\\'s a place we\\'ve been to quite a lot over the last few years. Every time we come back we enjoy it more and more and it certainly helps when you win as well.\" Michael Clarke took 6-9 on the final day and also contributed 400 runs in his first Test series. But the Man of the Series award went to team-mate Damien Martyn, who made 444 runs at an average of 55, although he ended it with a duck. \"I\\'d have liked 10 more runs in the second innings today,\" Martyn joked. \"We came over here to win and fight hard. It was a bit disappointing to finish off that way but we\\'ve won [the series] and the guiys have made a fantastic effort in the last month. \"We always know it\\'s going to be hard over here. It\\'s always a true test for a batsman.\"\\nSouth Africa far too strong again\\n\\nSecond one-day international, Durban South Africa 329-6 beat Zimbabwe 198-7 by 131 runs\\n\\nSouth Africa lead three-match series 2-0\\n\\nSmith\\'s 117 set up the best total at Durban in 25 one-day internationals. He was given fine support by Herschelle Gibbs - they added 134 before Justin Kemp hit 53 not out off just 21 balls. Zimbabwe finished on 198-7 to lose by 131 runs with Barney Rogers (47) the top-scorer. South Africa lead the series 2-0 with just one to play. Rogers put on 71 for the first wicket with Stuart Matsikenyeri. But their partnership soaked up 17.3 overs - Matsikenyeri labouring for 79 minutes over his innings of 16 before offering a catch off the bowling of Albie Morkel.\\n\\nThe same bowler struck soon afterwards as Rogers clipped a fullish delivery to wide mid-on. Nicky Boje and Adam Bacher each took a brace of wickets as the middle order simply played for pride. And it was telling that Bacher, whose military medium pace was not even experimented with against England, finished with 2-36 off a full allotment of 10 overs. Zimbabwe had won the toss at the start of the day and did well with the ball early on, reducing the South Africans to 67-3 in the 15th over. But Smith and Gibbs, who so often form a powerful partnership in both Tests and one-day internationals, were not backwards in coming forward, launching a barrage of boundaries off the spinners. Zimbabwe were hampered when strike bowler Tinashe Panyangara left the field in his fourth over with a back strain.\\n\\nThe spinners had to do plenty of work as a result and one of them, Prosper Utseya, went for 60 in six overs. Gibbs took a particular liking to him before eventually falling to Rogers for 75 off 73 balls. Seam bowler Christopher Mpofu took 3-59 in his nine overs. He was impressive in the main but had to bowl the final over of the innings, which disappeared for 17 as Justin Kemp equalled the fastest half-century by a South African. He hit two fours and five towering sixes in a brutal display of hitting. Afterwards, Kemp said he knew nothing about the record. \"I had no idea,\" he admitted. \"I was just thinking about smashing every ball for six.\"\\n\\nGraeme Smith (captain), Adam Bacher, Jacques Rudolph, Herschelle Gibbs, Ashwell Prince, Justin Kemp, Mark Boucher, Albie Morkel, Nicky Boje, Andrew Hall, Charl Langeveldt.\\n\\nStuart Matsikenyeri, Barney Rogers, Hamilton Masakadza, Alester Maregwede, Brendan Taylor, Tatenda Taibu (captain), Gavin Ewing, Sean Williams, Tinashe Panyangara, Prosper Utseya, Christopher Mpofu.\\nSri Lankans cleared of misconduct\\n\\nTwo Sri Lanka cricketers have been cleared of misconduct dating back to the ICC Champions Trophy in 2004.\\n\\nAvishka Gunawardene and Kaushal Lokuarachchi were both the subject of an official disciplinary inquiry after allegations of drunken misconduct. A Colombo newspaper had made the claims after a defeat against England in Southampton which led to Sri Lanka exiting the tournament early. But the disciplinary panel could find no evidence against the players. Sri Lanka Cricket chief executive Duleep Mendis said: \"Nobody was prepared to give evidence and there was absolutely no evidence to substantiate the article\\'s allegations.\" Gunawardene, 27, a hard-hitting opener, and Lokuarachchi, a 22-year-old leg-spinning all-rounder, were both dropped from the national squad after Sri Lanka\\'s tour of Pakistan in October.\\nStreak return could lift Zimbabwe\\n\\nOne-day international, Port Elizabeth: South Africa v Zimbabwe - starts Wednesday 1230 GMT\\n\\nTrailing 2-0 in the one-day series, news of Streak\\'s return has given the tourists a lift. But it is 12 months since his last international appearance and he will rely heavily on past experience. Boje leads South Africa in the absence of Graeme Smith, who is resting an ankle problem ahead of the Tests. The home side will also be without Jacques Kallis, Shaun Pollock, Makhaya Ntini and Andre Nel. Their absence offers Zimbabwe some hope of achieving only their third win in 21 one-day meetings between the two sides. The home side will give another opportunity to paceman Monde Zondeki, who took a wicket with his first ball in international cricket in December 2002, but has not been in favour since the following year\\'s tour to England. He could share the new ball with Charl Langevedlt, with all-rounders Albie Morkel, Boje, Justin Kemp and Adam Bacher providing the bowling back-up.\\n\\nN Boje (capt), A Bacher, M Boucher (Wkt), AB de Villiers, H Gibbs, J Kemp, C Langeveldt, A Morkel, A Prince, J Rudolph, M Zondeki.\\n\\nT Taibu (capt, wkt), B Rogers, S Matsikenyeri, H Masakadza, B Taylor, S Williams, G Ewing, T Mupariwa, E Chigumbura, P Utseya, T Panyangara, D Hondo, C Mpofu, G Cremer, H Streak.\\nPakistan accept venues compromise\\n\\nThe doubts surrounding Pakistan\\'s tour of India have receded after the two boards agreed to move the second Test from Ahmedabad to Calcutta.\\n\\nIn return for switching the Test, Pakistan have agreed to play an extra one-day international in Ahmedabad. \"The tour may get delayed by three to four days,\" said Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan. Ahmedabad was the scene of religious riots in 2002 and Pakistan\\'s cricketers had been wary of playing there. But a compromise solution was reached on Friday, a day after the tour schedule had been due to be confirmed. A sixth one-day international will be played in Ahmedabad to appease the Gujarat Cricket Association. The Pakistan Cricket Board initially suggested Mumbai as an alternative for the Ahmedabad Test, but it was agreed it would be played in Calcutta (Kolkata).\\n\\nKhan met India\\'s external affairs minister Natwar Singh in Islamabad on Thursday and also held telephone talks with Jagmohan Dalmiya, patron of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. \"We hope a final itinerary will be announced by the BCCI later on Friday,\" said Khan. \"We are in constant touch with them so we can agree on the dates for the tour to start because they have a lot of work to do. \"I am happy that the matter is resolved and the tour will get on smoothly.\"\\n\\nThe first and third Tests will take place at Mohali and Bangalore, while Cochin, Vishakapatnam, Delhi, Jamshedpur and Kanpur will stage the other five one-day internationals. The Indian government has confirmed that 8,000 visas will be granted to Pakistan supporters who wish to attend the Mohali Test. The seven-week tour will be Pakistan\\'s first to India in six years and their squad is due to be announced on Saturday. They were due to arrive in Delhi on 24 or 25 February and begin a three-day warm-up match on the 27th. However, TV rights have yet to be awarded, with a counter-petition from Zee due to be heard at the Madras High Court on Thursday. The BCCI backed out of a four-year deal with Zee last September after ESPN-Star Sports challenged it in court. Salim Altaf, the PCB\\'s Director of Cricket Operations, has been appointed team manager for the tour. He replaces former Test batsman Haroon Rashid. \"It\\'s another big responsibility and considering the importance of the tour I will try to do my best,\" Altaf said.\\nBatsman Van Jaarsveld joins Kent\\n\\nSouth African batsman Martin van Jaarsveld has ended his international career to sign a contract with Kent.\\n\\nThe 30-year-old will move to England under the Kolpak ruling, meaning he is not classed as an overseas player. Kent chief executive Paul Millman refused to disclose the length of the deal but told BBC Sport that he would be joining for \"at least two years\". \"We\\'ve been talking to him for some time but he was under contract so we had to stay silent,\" he continued. \"Now he has released himself from that, we are very happy that he\\'s joining us and has committed to playing for Kent.\"\\n\\nVan Jaarsveld played the last of his nine Tests for South Africa against England in December, but has since fallen down the pecking order. \"You need continuity in the dressing room. We had five overseas players last year and he\\'s freed himself up to be available for us for the whole season,\" Millman added. \"When you see that there are tours going on around the world it\\'s very difficult to pinpoint talent for a long period of time and this is the solution.\" Kent chairman of cricket Graham Johnson added: \"While at present we do not plan to engage a second overseas player, the option remains available to us should we wish to do so on a short-term basis.\" Van Jaarsveld hit 484 runs in seven County Championship matches with Northamptonshire last year and said the opportunity to return to county cricket was too good to turn down. \"Having understood that my future international prospects might be limited, I needed to weigh up my options and make a decision that was in the best interests of my long-term future,\" he explained. Van Jaarsveld\\'s domestic side in South Africa, the Centurion-based Titans, said the batsman may play for them in future. However, he would have to be classed as an overseas player in the Republic.\\nVaughan ready for South Africa\\n\\nSkipper Michael Vaughan is relieved England\\'s tour of Zimbabwe passed off without major incident and is now relishing the prospect of South Africa.\\n\\nVaughan\\'s men, who fly to Johannesburg on Monday, cruised to a series win over the Zimbabweans, but expect five tough Tests against Graeme Smith\\'s side. \"The Zimbabwe tour didn\\'t start very well but we came through it,\" he said. \"But I\\'m quite happy to be leaving and going onto Johannesburg for what is the exciting leg of the winter.\" The England captain said he hoped to take the batting form he has shown in Zimbabwe into the long tour of South Africa. Vaughan was man of the series as Zimbabwe were swept 4-0, with 211 runs at an average in excess of 100. He said: \"I realise I need to improve my one-day stats. Hopefully I can take this form into Test series in South Africa and the seven one-day games. \"It was a convincing series win. The boys did well in difficult situations.\" Vaughan said the youngsters who had filled in for some notable absentees had acquitted themselves well. He said: \"It was a tour where we gave opportunity to a few players and they have come in and done a very good job. \"It makes the selectors\\' job a little bit harder because we are producing a good pool of players.\" England\\'s six one-day specialists - Kevin Pietersen, Darren Gough, Vikram Solanki, Ian Bell, Matt Prior and Alex Wharf - will fly home to Heathrow on Monday night.\\n\\nThe remainder of the party will link up with the other members of the Test squad in Johannesburg, in preparation for the first Test, starting in Port Elizabeth on 17 December. Meanwhile Vaughan admitted he was disappointed, \"baffled and saddened\" by the absence of the Zimbabwe rebels from the controversial series. \"When you see Heath Streak sitting watching you in the stands it is disappointing Zimbabwe aren\\'t putting their best team on the field,\" Vaughan said. \"I\\'d like to have played against the Flower brothers (Andy and Grant), Heath Streak, and Stuart Carlisle, all of those guys.\" Streak said he felt Zimbabwean cricket would have been in better shape if the rebels were still involved. \"There are some talented players in this team and we could have formed a strong combination with them. You don\\'t enjoy watching your country lose badly,\" he said. \"I still have a lot of friends in the changing room, I don\\'t have any issues with the players. \"My issues are with Zimbabwe Cricket and the behaviour of some of the board members.\" Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu admitted: \"We are not quite there yet. We need a bit of experience and the more games we play the better we become. \"We are just getting individual performances on the day but we have to play good cricket for 100 overs and we have to get it together in a game and we really haven\\'t done that and really have to work on that. \"I\\'m very lucky that I have a bunch of young guys who really want to play for their country and give their best.\"\\nAustralia unchanged for Pakistan\\n\\nAustralia have named an unchanged squad for the first Test against Pakistan in Perth next Friday.\\n\\nMatthew Hayden missed the third one-day international against New Zealand with a hamstring strain but selectors decided not to name a standby player. Paceman Brett Lee is the 12th man but could be brought into the first team for next week\\'s contest. Lee has been 12th man in the last three Tests but has impressed in the New Zealand one-day series. Australia will enter the Pakistan game full of confidence after beating New Zealand 2-0 in their recent Test series.\\n\\nRicky Ponting (captain), Adam Gilchrist, Justin Langer, Matthew Hayden, Damien Martyn, Darren Lehmann, Michael Clarke, Shane Warne, Jason Gillespie, Michael Kasprowicz, Glenn McGrath, Brett Lee.\\nEngland slump to defeat\\n\\nFourth one-day international, Cape Town: South Africa 291-5 (50 overs) beat England 183 all out (41.2 overs) by 108 runs\\n\\nThe home side tallied a massive 291-5, with Gibbs making 100, Jacques Kallis 71 and Justin Kemp 57 from 36 balls. In reply, England were three wickets down inside eight overs, and bowled out for 183 in 41.2 overs. Kevin Pietersen smashed 75 from 85 balls but was caught in the deep trying to up the tempo. In all, 13 sixes were hit at a sun-baked Newlands, Kemp accounting for four of them with three each for Gibbs and Pietersen. Gibbs and Kallis, who both play for home side Western Province, set a new mark for the third wicket at this ground and beat their own record - set last week - for the third wicket against England with a stand of 143.\\n\\nThey set an even pace, notching half-centuries from successive deliveries, but still looked under par when Kallis was run out by a brilliant direct throw from Paul Collingwood at point. However, Kemp helped add 98 in the last 10 overs of the South African innings, building brutally on that platform. Kemp\\'s best six came off Darren Gough, a drive into the pavilion at long on, and Gough was actually hanging on to one of Gibbs\\' maximums, the momentum carrying him over the boundary rope. England looked like keeping pace only as far as the sixth over of their reply, when Geraint Jones edged Ntini behind with 32 on the board.\\n\\nCaptain Michael Vaughan, who returned from illness and replaced Vikram Solanki in the line-up, followed for a duck in the next over, edging Shaun Pollock to slip. And Marcus Trescothick went four balls later, playing around an Ntini yorker which took out his middle stump. Andrew Strauss, who made 17, and Paul Collingwood, with 11, both settled but failed to move on. And Pietersen was left to stage his own firework display, falling to his third successive slog-sweep off spinner Nicky Boje after the first two had flown over the square-leg boundary.\\n\\nPietersen, sporting a new hairstyle with a diagonal streak of bleached blond, took his series figures to 238 runs at an average of 119. Ntini had Ashley Giles caught at cover for 20 to finish with 3-29. Ignoring the fact that the team batting first has won 17 of the last 25 one-day internationals at the Cape Town ground, Vaughan had opted to put the home side in on winning the toss. He was forced into making changes early, though, as Steve Harmison struggled in his first match back from a calf injury. The pace bowler, who replaced Matthew Hoggard in the line-up, conceded 24 runs off his first three overs, including four wides.\\n\\nAlthough Darren Gough dismissed AB de Villiers lbw, he was also wayward early. And it took the arrival of Kabir Ali as the first-change bowler to apply the brakes. Ali, the hero of Wednesday\\'s tie in Bloemfontein dismissed Graeme Smith, the hero of Friday\\'s victory, lbw with a straight delivery that may have been a little too high. And with Collingwood in support his first six-over spell brought figures of 1-11. Ali\\'s early figures were decimated, though, in the closing stages as Gibbs and Kemp blazed to put the match out of reach. The teams meet again in East London on Wednesday for the fifth instalment of the seven-match series.\\n\\nG C Smith (capt), A B de Villiers, J H Kallis, H H Gibbs, A G Prince, J M Kemp, M V Boucher (wkt), S M Pollock, N Boje, M Ntini, A Nel.\\n\\nMP Vaughan (capt), M E Trescothick, G O Jones, A J Strauss, K P Pietersen, I R Bell, P D Collingwood, A F Giles, Kabir Ali, D Gough, S Harmison.\\nAustralia return to winning ways\\n\\nSecond one-day international, Sydney: Australia 261-7 (50 overs) beat New Zealand 244 (47.1 overs) by 17 runs\\n\\nAdam Gilchrist (60) and Darren Lehmann (52) played the leading roles as the home side totalled 261-7. New Zealand crumbled to 86-6 in reply but Chris Cairns hit 50 off 40 balls and Kyle Mills and Daniel Vettori put on 70 to keep their side in the hunt. But they were eventually all out for 244 and the three-match series will now be decided in Brisbane on Friday. The game came to an end at the start of the 48th over when Chris Harris, who bravely came out to bat in his 250th one-day game despite a shoulder injury, was bowled by a yorker from Glenn McGrath. Mills was left high and dry on 44 not out after a magnificent 26-ball innings, featuring four big sixes. There were plenty of anxious faces among the Australian fans during his ninth wicket stand with Vettori (33), who was finally run out by Ricky Ponting\\'s underarm throw. Home skipper Ponting had earlier chosen to bat after winning the toss and was rewarded as Adam Gilchrist took the attack to the New Zealand seamers. He struck a six and eight fours to reach his half century off only 37 deliveries, before perishing for 60 in cavalier fashion as a pull shot off Scott Styris was caught by Nathan Astle at deep square leg.\\n\\nPonting maintained the tempo with a quickfire 32 but his exit, caught at mid-off from the bowling of Mills, sparked a slump which saw Australia decline from 140-2 to 161-6. Matthew Hayden (43) was run out by Mathew Sinclair, Damien Martyn was lbw to Mills for five and Andrew Symonds faced only two balls before he was trapped in front by Vettori. Michael Clarke was next to go for six when he edged a ball from Chris Cairns to keeper Brendon McCullum. But Darren Lehmann and Brad Hogg prevented the innings from going into freefall, adding 74 in 17 overs for the seventh wicket. Lehmann was run out, leaving Hogg (41 not out) and Brett Lee (10 not out) to see the total past 250 to leave the Kiwis facing a tough target.\\n\\nThey made a poor start as Astle was caught behind off Brett Lee for 11 and Sinclair fell victim to Jason Gillespie for 17, with Matthew Hayden taking the catch. Captain Stephen Fleming fell lbw for 34 to left-arm spinner Hogg, who proved the most successful Australian bowler with figures of 3-45. The middle order followed in quick succession and it looked like the home side would wrap things up in double quick time. Cairns counter attacked with two sixes and four fours before Gillespie brought his innings to an end, leaving Mills and Vettori to try and secure an unlikely victory. The required rate came down to a run per ball thanks to Mills\\' big-hitting exploits, but Harris was greeted by a short-pitched ball aimed at his chest and a ferocious full toss from Lee after Vettori had been dismissed. The veteran, whose suffered a torn rotator cuff while fielding earlier in the game, collected four singles but his gallantry was in vain as McGrath produced the perfect delivery to bring the game to an end.\\n\\nM Hayden, A Gilchrist (wkt), R Ponting (capt), D Lehmann, D Martyn, A Symonds, M Clarke, B Hogg, J Gillespie, B Lee, G McGrath.\\n\\nS Fleming (capt), N Astle, M Sinclair, S Styris, H Marshall, J Oram, C Cairns, C Harris, B McCullum (wkt), D Vettori, K Mills.\\nWilkinson to miss Ireland match\\n\\nEngland will have to take on Ireland in the Six Nations without captain and goal-kicker Jonny Wilkinson, according to his Newcastle boss Rob Andrew.\\n\\nWilkinson - who had targeted the 27 February match for his international comeback - has been missed by England, not least for his goal-kicking. \"Jonny\\'s not fit yet,\" Falcons chief Andrew told BBC Radio Five Live. \"He won\\'t be fit for Dublin, there\\'s no doubt about that, but he might be fit for Scotland and Italy.\" The 25-year-old has not played for England since the 2003 World Cup final after a succession of injuries. England, who have lost three Six Nations games in a row, wasted a 17-6 half-time lead in their 18-17 defeat to France. Goal-kickers Charlie Hodgson and Olly Barkley missed six penalty attempts and a drop-goal between them. \"They\\'ve probably got two of the best English kickers in the Premiership in Hodgson and Barkley,\" added Andrew, a former England fly-half and goal-kicker.\\n\\n\"They\\'re both pretty good kickers. Charlie is a good kicker week-in, week-out. \"But it\\'s all about pressure and unfortunately England are just not handling the pressure at the moment.\" Andrew also blamed England\\'s poor run of recent results on a lack of leadership in the side following several high-profile retirements and injuries. \"They just didn\\'t have that leadership that would have seen them through. Martin Johnson, Lawrence Dallaglio and Jonny are obviously huge losses and leadership is so important in those situations,\" he said. \"I think it is really difficult for Jason Robinson to lead the side effectively from full-back.\" Meanwhile, former England full-back Dusty Hare put England\\'s mistakes down to a lack of mental toughness.\\n\\n\"Jonny Wilkinson has proved himself a cool customer with around an 80% kicking success rate,\" Hare told BBC Radio Five Live. \"But natural-born toughness comes into it as well as all the practice you do. \"You have to be able to shut out all the outside elements and concentrate on putting the ball between the posts.\" Hodgson, who has an excellent kicking record with club side Sale Sharks, has introduced crowd noise into his practice routine of late. \"The top golfers don\\'t hit the fairway every time, and it is the same with goal-kicking,\" Hare added. \"You need that mental toughness as well to put the ball over, but great goal-kickers like Jonny Wilkinson come along very rarely.\"\\nTeenager Tait picked for England\\n\\nNewcastle\\'s teenage centre Mathew Tait has been named as a centre in England\\'s team to face Wales in the Six Nations opener in Cardiff on Saturday.\\n\\nThe 18-year-old will play alongside Falcons\\' team-mate Jamie Noon in England\\'s midfield. Scrum-half Matt Dawson is also recalled, despite been left out of the initial squad after a row over clashing TV and training commitments. Bath lock Danny Grewcock will also start, pending a possible citing. England coach Andy Robinson has also awarded Gloucester flanker Andy Hazell his first Six Nations start. In another change to the side that lost to Australia in November, Leicester lock Ben Kay replaces Bath second row Steve Borthwick.

He will undergo an operation on Monday and is expected to be out for at least six weeks. He said: \"This isn\\'t an injury that will stop me from working hard on the fitness elements and being around the lads.\" He added: \"I\\'ve got the operation this afternoon and I could be back doing fitness work after a week.\" \"As frustrating as it is, I\\'ve got to be positive.\"\\n\\nAfter the game, Vickery spoke with Bath prop David Barnes, who also broke his arm recently. \"I had a chat with David Barnes and it looks like a similar injury to him,\" he said. \"He said he had the operation and he was back running after a week. \"There\\'s no doubt that I\\'m going to get involved and be around this place as soon as I can after the operation.\" Gloucester director of rugby Nigel Melville said: \"Phil has broken his radius, which is the large bone in his forearm. \"I don\\'t really know how it happened, but Phil will definitely be out of action for at least six weeks. \"I feel very sorry for him, as he has been in great shape. He really needed 80 minutes of rugby this weekend, and then this happened. Mentally, it must be very hard for him.\"\\nBarbarians 19-47 New Zealand\\n\\nNew Zealand proved too strong for an Australian-dominated Barbarians to round off their unbeaten northern hemisphere tour with an easy win.\\n\\nRico Gear ran in two of the All Blacks\\' seven tries in what was a predominantly second-string line-up. The Baa-Baas did threaten, scoring tries through Albert van den Bergh, Xavier Rush and Andrea Lo Cicero, but never looked like winning. All Black Aaron Mauger was in good form with the boot, adding 10 points. The All Blacks featured only two of the side which started last weekend\\'s emphatic Test victory over France in Paris, while the Baa-Baas had nine Wallabies in their starting line-up. And New Zealand coach Graham Henry said: \"It was a quality performance against a very experienced side and a number of young guys came through very well. \"They learnt from the older players and this was a way of thanking the guys who had been mentoring them on the tour.\" But the running rugby the crowd had been hoping for rarely materialised. Marty Holah got the All Blacks onslaught under way with his fifth-minute try before Rush hit back moments later. But New Zealand went ahead once more as Gear made use of the space vacated by a temporarily injured Chris Latham to slide in. Ma\\'a Nonu then found his way through the Barbarians defence to give his side a 19-7 half-time lead. The hosts failed to ignite in the second half and, the moment Gear scored his second just after the interval, there was only ever going to be one winner. Lo Cicero, the sole European for the Barbarians, bundled over for a try to briefly curtail the deficit. But the match was blighted by controversy moments later when Justin Marshall, was felled with a high tackle by Jimmy Cowan. Referee Andy Turner waved play on and Casey Laulala coasted in for his side\\'s fifth try. Jermoe Keino and Piri Weepu both added tries to the All Blacks\\' tally before the final whistle, while van den Bergh gained some consolation for the Baa-Baas. After the match, Barbarians coach Bob Dwyer warned that South African flanker Schalk Burger needed a proper off-season break to maintain his standards. Burger, 21, was recently crowned player of the year by both his peers and the International Rugby Board, but has struggled for form in recent weeks. \"It\\'s his first year at that level and he was phenomenal up until the end of the southern hemisphere season. \"I don\\'t think he\\'s played anywhere near that level on tour,\" he said.\\nTindall wants second opinion\\n\\nEngland centre Mike Tindall is to seek a second opinion before having surgery on a foot injury that could force him to miss the entire Six Nations.\\n\\nThe Bath player was already out of the opener against Wales on 5 February because of a hand problem. \"Mike had a specialist review on a fracture in his right mid foot,\" said England doctor Simon Kemp. \"Before a final decision is made on surgery... medical teams have decided he should see a second specialist.\"\\n\\nEngland coach Andy Robinson is already without centre Will Greenwood and flanker Richard Hill while fly-half Jonny Wilkinson is certain to miss at least the first two games. Robinson is expected to announce his new-look England line-up on Monday for the match at the Millennium Stadium. And Newcastle\\'s 18-year-old centre Mathew Tait is set to stand in for Tindall alongside club team-mate Jamie Noon.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Tindall is targeting a return to action before the end of the regular Zurich Premiership season on 30 April. He will also aim to be back to full fitness before the Lions tour to New Zealand this summer.\\nD\\'Arcy injury adds to Ireland woe\\n\\nGordon D\\'Arcy has been ruled out of the Ireland team for Saturday\\'s Six Nations clash against Scotland in Murrayfield.\\n\\nLike skipper Brian O\\'Driscoll, D\\'Arcy failed to recover from a hamstring injury. The side will now be led by Munster lock Paul O\\'Connell. Shane Horgan switches from wing to centre where he will be joined by Ulster\\'s Kevin Maggs. Girvan Dempsey comes into the team to take the right wing spot while Gavin Duffy is called up to the replacements. \\'\\'We gave Gordon a chance but it didn\\'t work out,\\'\\' said Ireland coach Eddie O\\'Sullivan. \\'\\'In terms of the risk element, it was a sensible precaution. He should be fine for the next game but we do not want to tempt fate.\\'\\'\\n\\nMaggs, who will win his 67th cap, was the obvious replacement at centre while Shane Horgan was always likely to be moved from the wing. The only other change to the Ireland side from last weekend\\'s win in Rome sees Wasps flanker Johnny O\\'Connor replacing Denis Leamy. O\\'Connor will be winning his third cap after making his debut in the victory over South Africa last November.\\n\\n: Murphy, Dempsey, Horgan, Maggs, Hickie, O\\'Gara, Stringer, Corrigan, Byrne, Hayes, O\\'Kelly, O\\'Connell, capt, S Easterby, O\\'Connor, Foley.\\n\\n: Sheahan, Horan, O\\'Callaghan, Miller, G Easterby, Humphreys, Duffy.\\nDouble injury blow strikes Wales\\n\\nWales centre Sonny Parker and number eight Ryan Jones will miss Saturday\\'s game with Italy because of injury.\\n\\nParker has not recovered from a trapped nerve in his neck that kept him out of the win over England, and Tom Shanklin is expected to continue at centre. Jones damaged his collar bone after coming on as a replacement against England and joins flanker Colin Charvis (foot injury) on the sidelines. Meanwhile, Mike Ruddock may make Gavin Henson his first-choice kicker in Rome. The centre was Wales\\' hero in the 11-9 Six Nations win over England, landing a huge late penalty from wide out to clinch the game. First-choice kicker Stephen Jones handed over responsibility because of Henson\\'s greater kicking range, but the fly-half had already missed a number of shots at goal. \"Our first aim was to get Gavin settled into the team, but giving him the kicks is something we\\'ll talk about in selection this week,\" Wales coach Mike Ruddock told BBC Sport Wales. Henson himself says he is relishing all the media hype that has been heaped on him since last Saturday\\'s game. \"I thrive on it and think it makes me perform better,\" he said. \"I\\'m glad it\\'s a short week before the Italy game. There was so much build-up before England, but we fly out to Rome on Thursday and we\\'ll be back playing again.\"\\nStevens named in England line-up\\n\\nEngland have named Bath prop Matt Stevens in the starting line-up for their Six Nations match against Ireland at Lansdowne Road on Sunday.\\n\\nFellow Bath prop Duncan Bell will start on the bench, as coach Andy Robinson makes just one change to the team that was beaten by France. It will be Stevens\\' first start after two caps as a replacement against the All Blacks last year. Leicester duo Ollie Smith and Andy Goode have been drafted onto the bench. Stevens takes over from Phil Vickery, who suffered a broken arm playing for Gloucester last weekend. \"I\\'m confident Matt will grasp this opportunity and make his mark against Ireland,\" said Robinson.\\n\\n\"All three players have shown outstanding form of late, most recently in the England A win against France A and for their club,\" added Robinson. \"Selection beckons when players demonstrate such consistent ability. \"This game against Ireland will be massive. We recognise it\\'s a must-win game for us this season.\" England confirmed that Sale Sharks prop Andrew Sheridan was not considered for selection because of an injury he picked up to the back of his ankle during last Friday\\'s match against Leeds.\\n\\nJ Robinson (Sale Sharks, capt); M Cueto (Sale Sharks), J Noon (Newcastle), O Barkley (Bath), J Lewsey (Wasps); C Hodgson (Sale Sharks), H Ellis (Leicester); G Rowntree (Leicester), S Thompson (Northampton), M Stevens (Bath), D Grewcock (Bath), B Kay (Leicester), J Worsley (Wasps), L Moody (Leicester), M Corry (Leicester).\\n\\nA Titterrell (Sale Sharks), D Bell (Bath), S Borthwick (Bath), A Hazell (Gloucester), M Dawson (Wasps), A Goode (Leicester), O Smith (Leicester).\\nWilkinson to lead England\\n\\nFly-half Jonny Wilkinson has been named as England\\'s new rugby union captain for the three November Tests.\\n\\nThe 25-year-old Newcastle star takes over from Lawrence Dallaglio, who retired from internationals in August. England\\'s acting head coach Andy Robinson said: \"He is a natural leader, holds the respect of the squad and is a formidable talent on the pitch. \"And he consistently demonstrates the energy and commitment I feel is essential to be captain of England.\" Robinson added: \"There are several players in the squad I would feel comfortable in calling upon to be England captain but for me Jonny is in every way the right player to take on this challenge. \"Captaincy offers a challenging environment for any player, especially following in the footsteps of Lawrence Dallaglio and before him the World Cup captain, Martin Johnson.\\n\\n\"But I am confident Jonny has what it takes to do an outstanding job as we look ahead towards the next Rugby World Cup in France and I look forward to working with him.\" Wilkinson, who has scored 817 points in 52 internationals, kicked the winning drop-goal in the final seconds of extra-time in England\\'s 2003 Rugby World Cup triumph against Australia. But he then missed the entire 2004 Six Nations campaign while recuperating from shoulder surgery, before making his comeback for Newcastle in the Zurich Premiership in August. \"It\\'s the ambition of so many players to one day be captain of England and today I have realised a dream,\" he said. \"I\\'m honoured Andy wants me to be his captain, and to follow Lawrence and Martin means a lot to me as they are inspirational men who have given so much to England rugby over many years.\\n\\n\"Getting my first England cap against Ireland six years ago was something I\\'ll never forget because to play for your country is very special. Taking on the captaincy is another important step in my career and I do so with immense pride.\" Wilkinson made his international debut in the 1998 Six Nations Championship against Ireland when he came off the bench to replace Paul Grayson.\\n\\nHe has been a regular in the England starting line-up ever since, played in all three Lions Tests in 2001 and all but one of England\\'s games in the 2003 World Cup. He becomes the 117th captain of England since Fred Stokes held the position in 1871. England\\'s first autumn Test is against Canada on 13 November, followed by the visit of Tri-Nations champions South Africa a week later and then a World Cup re-match with Australia.\\nKirwan demands Italy consistency\\n\\nItaly coach John Kirwan has challenged his side to match the performance they produced in pushing Ireland close when they meet Wales on Saturday.\\n\\nDespite losing 28-17 in Sunday\\'s Six Nations encounter, the Italians confirmed their continuing improvement. \"Our goal is to match every side we face and against Ireland we showed we could do that,\" said Kirwan. \"But the most important thing is that we build on that performance when we play Wales on Saturday.\" Italy\\'s half-backs had a mixed afternoon, with recalled scrum-half Alessandro Troncon impressing but fly-half Luciano Orquera having an off-day with the boot. Kirwan said: \"I was very happy with Troncon. He had an incredible game - he was very good in attack and defence. \"Orquera\\'s kicking was off but he showed great courage in defence. \"He also followed the game plan. We have to give him confidence because he has the capability to do well.\"\\nLaporte tinkers with team\\n\\nFrance coach Bernard Laporte has made four changes to the starting line-up that beat England for Saturday\\'s Six Nations clash with Wales.\\n\\nHe opted for Yannick Nyanga in the back row instead of Grand Slam winner Imanol Harinordoquy, who is back in the squad. Other changes see Julien Laharrague win his first cap at full-back, Aurelien Rougerie return after injury on the wing and Yannick Jauzion in at centre. But Laporte has resisted fan pressure to start Frederic Michalak at fly-half. The dependable Yann Delaigue keeps the number 10 jersey, despite clamours for the flair of Michalak. The 26-year-old Laharrague gets his chance despite playing on the wing for his club Brive.\\n\\n\"We are launching him into the great international level,\" said team manager Jo Maso. \"He is young and this is a great opportunity for us and above all for him. \"There are 25 matches left before the World Cup so we must see as many players as possible. The competition is very high and open.\" Jauzion, France\\'s player of the year in 2004, would probably have played in the first two matches instead of the South African-born Liebeneberg had he been fit. The Stade Toulousain star wins his 23rd cap and is reunited with Damien Traille, with whom he forged an effective midfield in 2004. \"The return of Jauzion is going to be a plus for us,\" said Laporte. \"We are going to test him at an international level.\"\\n\\nJulien Laharrague (Brive), Aurelien Rougerie (Clermont), Yannick Jauzion (Stade Toulousain), Damien Traille (Biarritz), Christophe Dominici (Stade Francais), Yann Delaigue (Castres), Dimitri Yachvili (Biarritz), Julien Bonnaire (Bourgoin), Yannick Nyanga (Beziers), Serge Betsen (Biarritz), Jerome Thion (Biarritz), Fabien Pelous (Stade Toulousain, capt), Nicolas Mas (Perpignan), Sebastien Bruno (Sale), Sylvain Marconnet (Stade Francais)\\n\\nReplacements: William Servat (Stade Toulousain), Olivier Milloud (Bourgoin), Gregory Lamboley (Stade Toulousain), Imanol Harinordoquy (Biarritz), Pierre Mignoni (Clermont), Frederic Michalak (Stade Toulousain), Jean-Philippe Grandclaude (Perpignan)\\nFunding cut hits Wales Students\\n\\nThe Wales Students rugby side has become a casualty of the Welsh Rugby Union\\'s reorganisation at youth level.\\n\\nAn amalgamated Under-18 side formed from separate schools and national youth teams plays its first match on Thursday, against Italy at the Gnoll. But that move has seen the WRU decide to end its funding of representative sides such as Wales Students. As a result, traditional international fixtures against England and France in the New Year have been cancelled. The Welsh Students Rugby Football Union feels that it is unable to properly prepare for or stage the matches. The secretary of the Welsh Students Rugby Football Union, Reverend Eldon Phillips, said: \"It is a shame that fixtures cannot be maintained this year. \"The competition provided by the strong English and French teams has enabled the Welsh Students to test themselves in high quality matches. \"The increasing number of young rugby players entering Higher Education look for the biggest challenge, that is representative rugby, but this year that opportunity will be denied them. Players who have played for Wales Students before going on to win full senior representative honours include Robert Jones, Rob Howley, Jon Humphreys, Darren Morris, Martyn Williams and Ceri Sweeney.\\nMoody joins up with England\\n\\nLewis Moody has flown to Dublin to join England\\'s camp ahead of their RBS Six Nations game against Ireland on Sunday.\\n\\nDespite joining the squad, the Leicester flanker only has a \"slim\" chance of playing because of an infection in his finger. A decision will be taken on Saturday as to whether the 26-year-old will be declared fit. If he fails to recover in time for the game, his place at the back of the pack will be taken by Andy Hazell. Chris Jones will then start the game on the bench. \"The chances of him playing are very slim,\" said coach Andy Robinson. \"The infection is deeper than was thought.\"\\n\\nMoody had to be put on a drip in an attempt to force antibiotics through his infected finger. He suffered the cut playing against France at Twickenham and it became infected during a 10-minute outing as a replacement for Leicester against Newcastle last Saturday. \"The mud got into it,\" Robinson added. \"He has had a big course of antibiotics but they haven\\'t done the job we hoped they would.\" Robinson has already been forced to make one change to the starting line-up with Bath prop Matt Stevens coming in for the injured Phil Vickery.\\n\\nThe 22-year-old has only made 10 starts for his club but has made 49 appearances from the bench. \"It can be frustrating but I\\'ve had a lot more game time this season and I\\'m ready for it,\" Stevens said. \"I\\'ve been on tour with these boys and I\\'ve been in the England set-up for two years so I know the calls and the way they play.\" Stevens will be winning his third cap on Sunday after coming on twice as a replacement on the tour to New Zealand last year.\\n\\nRobinson has confirmed that fly-half Charlie Hodgson will be the first-choice kicker despite his three missed penalties and a drop goal against France. \"Charlie\\'s state of mind is very good,\" said Robinson. \"Obviously, we are all disappointed we lost the French game and the circumstances in which we did. \"But he responded well last week in his goalkicking for Sale and he will be our first-choice kicker this week.\"\\n\\nRobinson also admits his side must improve their line-out work against Irish duo Malcolm O\\'Kelly and Paul O\\'Connell, one of the most effective partnerships in the game. \"In each game we\\'ve missed a number of line-outs,\" he added. \"It cost us the game against Wales but it has improved. \"It was better against France and will have to go up another notch against Ireland. It will be a huge battle. \"Look at the way they tore us apart last year. If it doesn\\'t function, we will be in for a torrid time.\"\\nEngland claim Dubai Sevens glory\\n\\nEngland beat Fiji 26-21 in a dramatic final in Dubai to win the first IRB Sevens event of the season.\\n\\nHaving beaten Australia and South Africa to reach the final, England fell behind to an early try against Fiji. They then took charge with scores from Pat Sanderson, Kai Horstman, Mathew Tait and Rob Thirlby, but Fiji rallied to force a tense finale. Scotland were beaten 33-15 by Samoa in the plate semi-final and Ireland lost 17-5 to Tunisia in the shield final. Mike Friday\\'s England side matched their opponents for pace, power and skill in the final and led 19-7 at half-time. But Neumi Nanuku and Marika Vakacegu touched down for Fiji, only for a needless trip by Tuidriva Bainivalu on Geoff Appleford to allow England to run down the clock. \"To be honest, England have wanted to win in Dubai for a very long time now, and the people here have wanted us to win for just as long,\" said Friday.\\n\\n\"We didn\\'t want to put pressure on ourselves but we are thankful we have achieved that and brought through some young talent at the same time that can hopefully play for the England \\'15s\\' in a few years.\" Portugal confirmed their impressive progress in Sevens rugby by recording a sudden-death win over France in the bowl final. Samoa won the plate title by edging out Argentina 21-19.\\n\\nWood - Ireland can win Grand Slam\\n\\nFormer captain Keith Wood believes Ireland can win only their second Grand Slam - and first since 1948 - in this year\\'s RBS Six Nations Championship.\\n\\nAfter claiming their first Triple Crown for 19 years last season, Wood tips his former team-mates to go one better. \"Things have been building up over the past few years and I think this is the year for Ireland,\" he told BBC Sport. \"There is a great chance to win a Grand Slam. A lot of things are in our favour with England and France at home.\" Ireland have finished runners-up three times, including last year, since the old Five Nations became Six in 2000, and not finished outside the top three in the past five years.\\n\\nDespite being without flanker Keith Gleeson, coach Eddie O\\'Sullivan has not had to contend with the sort of casualty lists that have hit England and Scotland in particular prior to the tournament. \"For Ireland to win it we need to stay relatively injury free, and fortunately we are one of the few teams that have done that so far,\" Wood added. \"It is going to be tough and we need to take all the luck and opportunities that come our way.\" Ireland\\'s last game of the tournament is against Wales in Cardiff - a fixture they have not lost since 1983.\\n\\nBut despite their traditional hospitality when the Irish are visiting, Wood believes Wales might end their four-match losing run against England in Cardiff. \"So many of the major England players have either retired in the last year or are injured that I think it will be very hard for them down in Cardiff,\" Wood added. \"Wales have had four brilliant games in the last year or so and lost all four, so the time is right for them now to beat one of the major teams.\"\\nHong Kong in 2011 World Cup bid\\n\\nHong Kong is hoping to join Japan as co-host of the 2011 Rugby World Cup.\\n\\nJapan has applied to host the tournament on its own, with the aim of taking it outside rugby\\'s traditional strongholds for the first time. But Hong Kong Rugby Football Union (HKRFU) chairman John Molloy has called for the territory to host one of the pools and a quarter-final. The Japanese Rugby Football Union (JRFU) says it has yet to receive a formal presentation from the HKRFU. \"At this stage, we are only considering hosting the event by ourselves,\" said JRFU secretary Koji Tokumasu. \"We cannot examine any proposal unless we get it in a definitive form.\" Japan faces stiff competition in the form of South Africa and New Zealand to host the event in seven years\\' time.\\n\\n\"Until now, the World Cup has been held in countries from the Six Nations or Tri-Nations,\" said Tokumasu. \"We think, and the IRB thinks, that it is time for rugby to go global. \"Japan is ready to host the tournament and we are looking forward to welcoming the world of rugby to Japan.\" Tokumasu added that the 2002 football World Cup, co-hosted by Japan and South Korea, had been a huge success. \"As well as having the infrastructure in place, Japan also has the commercial clout to host one of sport\\'s top competitions,\" he said. Last year, Japan launched its first professional rugby league and it has the fourth largest number of registered players (125,508) in the world after England, South Africa and France.\\nNewcastle 27-27 Gloucester\\n\\nNewcastle centre Mathew Tait answered his critics as he scored one try and made another, but he could not stop Gloucester grabbing a draw.\\n\\nThe Falcons were 22-6 down at the break before Tait, recently axed by England after just one Six Nations outing, inspired his side to a 27-22 lead. A last-gasp touchdown from Luke Narraway pulled the visitors level. But Gloucester missed out on victory when Henry Paul fluffed the conversion and Seti Kiole was denied a late try. Newcastle had a couple of chances at the start of the second half with line-outs in the corner. But they failed to make them count until Joe Shaw found Dave Walder, who released Mark Mayerholfer in his own 22.\\n\\nThe former All Black broke clear and popped the ball up for Tait on halfway. He chipped ahead for Michael Stephenson to scorch through for the try, which Walder converted to give Newcastle a lifeline. They grabbed it with both hands, Mayerhofler breaking through and Tait making a brilliant early run to cut inside and race 30m to score. Walder converted to make it 22-20 before he was just wide with a 40m penalty in the 70th minute.\\n\\nMayerhofler then scythed through the middle for a try after Hall Charlton popped the ball up, and Walder\\'s conversion took Newcastle 27-22 ahead. With three minutes of normal time left, Narraway was driven over for a try in the corner which levelled the scores at 27-27. Henry missed the conversion but Gloucester nearly won it when Kiole broke through only to be hauled down by Charlton and Tom May.\\n\\nWalder; May, Tait, Mayerhofler, Stephenson; Wilkinson, Grindal; Isaacson, Long, Ward; Gross, Hamilton; McCarthy, Harris, Dowson.\\n\\nReplacements: Peel, Wilson, Thompson, Parling, Sititi, Charlton, Shaw.\\n\\nGoodridge; Garvey, Simpson-Daniel, Fanolua, Kiole; Paul, Gomarsall; Wood, Curnier, Powell; Eustace, Brown; Forrester, Buxton, Balding.\\n\\nReplacements: Elloway, Sigley, Cornwell, Narraway, Page, Davies, Mauger.\\nWales want rugby league training\\n\\nWales could follow England\\'s lead by training with a rugby league club.\\n\\nEngland have already had a three-day session with Leeds Rhinos, and Wales are thought to be interested in a similar clinic with rivals St Helens. Saints coach Ian Millward has given his approval, but if it does happen it is unlikely to be this season. Saints have a week\\'s training in Portugal next week, while Wales will play England in the opening Six Nations match on 5 February. \"We have had an approach from Wales,\" confirmed a Saints spokesman. \"It\\'s in the very early stages but it is something we are giving serious consideration to.\" St Helens, who are proud of their Welsh connections, are obvious partners for the Welsh Rugby Union, despite a spat in 2001 over the collapse of Kieron Cunningham\\'s proposed £500,000 move to union side Swansea. A similar cross-code deal that took Iestyn Harris from Leeds to Cardiff in 2001 did go through, before the talented stand-off returned to the 13-man code with Bradford Bulls. Kel Coslett, who famously moved from Wales to league in the 1960s, is currently Saints\\' football manager, while Clive Griffiths - Wales\\' defensive coach - is a former St Helens player and is thought to be the man behind the latest initiative. Scott Gibbs, the former Wales and Lions centre, played for St Helens from 1994-96 and was in the Challenge Cup-winning team at Wembley in 1996.\\nBortolami predicts dour contest\\n\\nItaly skipper Marco Bortolami believes Saturday\\'s Six Nations contest against Scotland will be a scrappy encounter.\\n\\nWith both sides looking for their first win of the championship, the third-round game at Murrayfield has been billed as a wooden-spoon decider. And Bortolami feels the Edinburgh contest could end up being a bruising battle of the packs. \"It will not be a pretty game because both teams are desperate to gain their first win,\" said the lock forward. Italy have only recorded three wins since they joined the Six Nations in 2000, but two of those have come against Scotland. This year, Italy opened up with a stubborn display against Ireland but ended up losing 28-17.\\n\\nHowever, they were thoroughly outplayed by an impressive Welsh side in Rome last time out. Now the Italians travel to Edinburgh hoping to claim their first away win in the Six Nations. \"Scotland played extremely well against France in Paris but not so well when Ireland came to Edinburgh,\" said Bortolami. \"We are still very disappointed with our last game against Wales in Rome and we are thoroughly determined to right the wrongs. \"As a nation, our quest is to be respected as a team worthy of a place in this tournament and we can only do this by winning games.\"\\nDominici backs lacklustre France\\n\\nWing Christophe Dominici says France can claim another Six Nations Grand Slam despite two lacklustre wins so far against Scotland and England.\\n\\nThe champions only just saw off the Scots in Paris, then needed England to self-destruct in last week\\'s 18-17 win. \"The English played better than us but lost, whereas we are still in the race for the Grand Slam,\" said Dominici. \"We know our display was not perfect, but we can still win the Grand Slam, along with Ireland and Wales.\" France , Ireland and Wales all remain unbeaten after two rounds of this year\\'s RBS Six Nations, with the two Celtic nations playing by far the more impressive rugby.\\n\\nFrance take on Wales at the Stade de France on 26 February and Ireland in Dublin on 12 March. But although France have yet to click, Dominici says that they can still win the hard way as long as scrum-half Dimitri Yachvili continues in his goalkicking form. \"If we have an efficient kicker on whom we can rely on, a solid defence and a team who play for their lives, we can achieve something,\" Dominici added. \"I said at the start of the competition that the winners would be clearer from the third matches, and that\\'s exactly what is going to happen.\" France coach Bernard Laporte will announce his starting line-up next Tuesday for the match against Wales.\\n\\nWing Jimmy Marlu is definitely out with the knee injury sustained at Twickenham, which is likely to sideline him for the rest of the tournament. Inspirational flanker Serge Betsen is a doubt with a thigh injury, but number eight Imanol Harinordoquy has shaken off his shoulder injury. In the backs, centre Yannick Jauzion and winger Aurelien Rougerie are all back in contention after injury, while Brive back Julien Laharrague has received his first call-up as a replacement for Pepito Elhorga.\\nWales stars need a rest - Ruddock\\n\\nWales coach Mike Ruddock has defended his decision not to release any of the international stars for this weekend\\'s regional Celtic League fixtures.\\n\\nRuddock says the players will benefit from the rest, and their absence will give youngsters a chance to impress. \"We\\'ve got the WRU charter in place now which outlines exactly what happens,\" Ruddock told BBC Wales Sport. \"Once we\\'re in the Six Nations, the players will only be released in his and the WRU\\'s best interests.\" The Ospreys and Scarlets say they are happy to support the Wales cause, but the Dragons have expressed disappointment at not being able to use their national squad players in Friday\\'s game with Ulster. Ceri Sweeney, Gareth Cooper, Ian Gough and Kevin Morgan have been used sparingly by Ruddock in the opening two Six Nations wins and captain Jason Forster believes they would benefit from a game with the Dragons.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure the guys would want to come back to get some game time,\" Forster told BBC Wales Sport. \"It would also be a timely reminder to Mike [Ruddock] as to what they can do. \"And the supporters want to see the star players - no disrespect to the other guys - performing on the pitch.\" Ruddock, though, is keen to protect his players from injury and fatigue. \"At this stage, there\\'s nothing more [the players] can do in games to impress me further. \"We\\'ve got to look at it at another angle and see the opportunities that are provided for the younger players in the region. \"For example, the Dragons might use James Ireland this weekend. I\\'ve been looking at the lad - he\\'s a great prospect for the future.\" French and English clubs have requested to have all their international players available which means Stephen Jones, Gareth Thomas and Mefin Davies will play this weekend. The majority of Ireland and Scotland players have also been released for provincial duty.\\nWilkinson: Injuries toughened me\\n\\nEngland skipper Jonny Wilkinson insists his battle with injuries during 2004 has toughened him up mentally.\\n\\nThe fly-half returned to action for Newcastle in their 13-10 Heineken Cup win at Edinburgh at the weekend after seven weeks out with a bicep problem. Wilkinson, who also endured an eight-month lay-off with a shoulder injury, said: \"I was physically prepared for my first return but mentally it was hard. \"But having had this little time out since then I feel mentally stronger.\" The 25-year-old, who has not played for England since drop-kicking his country to World Cup glory in November 2003, also admits he may have rushed his initial comeback in September.\\n\\nWilkinson says he does not plan to push himself too far too fast this time around. \"No-one can prepare you for what it\\'s like to come back after basically an entire season out injured,\" Wilkinson added. \"The first time round, I\\'d done all the training and was more motivated than I\\'ve ever been.\\n\\n\"But sometimes that was met with disappointment after a few of the games, wondering why things were not working out when I thought I\\'d done all the right things in preparation. \"I think that\\'s what I\\'ve changed this time, trying to be a bit more realistic about coming back. \"I\\'m not in any way less ambitious - but I just understand that I should get on with it and enjoy it.\" Wilkinson also praised Dave Walder, who has been filling in for him for the Falcons. And he said the experience of starting a game on the bench - as happened against Edinburgh - has made him more appreciative of the role of replacement players. \"I hated the experience of being on the bench,\" Wilkinson said. \"But what it\\'s done is given me enormous respect and admiration for players who can do that on a regular basis, and Dave Walder has been playing well in the team - so I have to accept it.\\n\\n\"To be an effective replacement is a skill in itself, and some of our players are fantastic at it. \"When you start the game you\\'re fully involved, and you react to each second as it goes by - whereas as a replacement you have to watch the game tick by and then almost instantly switch on and join in when everyone else has had time to bed themselves into the match. \"It\\'s so difficult, especially in a decision-making role - which is something our scrum halves, Hall Charlton and James Grindal, do on a regular basis to good effect.\"\\nMunster Cup tie switched to Spain\\n\\nMunster\\'s Heineken Cup quarter-final tie against Biarritz on 3 April has been switched to Real Sociedad\\'s Paseo de Anoeta stadium in San Sebastian.\\n\\nReal\\'s ground holds 32,000 whereas the Parc des Sports Aguilera in Biarritz has a capacity of just 12,667. The Irish province will be given at least 8,000 tickets. \"The decision to move was a difficult one, but as we considered the fans as one of our primary objectives,\" said Biarritz chairman Marcel Martin. \"We hope we will be rewarded as a huge crowd behaving in the best rugby tradition.\" The match will be the first Heineken Cup fixture to be played in Spain, and is expected to attract the biggest-ever attendance for a rugby match in the country. Ulster were the last Irish team to play at the Paseo de Anoeta stadium where they faced a Euskarians side during a pre-season tour in 1998.\\nFrance v Wales (Sat)\\n\\nStade de France, Paris\\n\\nSaturday, 26 February\\n\\n1600 GMT\\n\\nBBC1, Radio 4 LW and this website\\n\\nFrance may have beaten Scotland and England but they were tedious and uninspired throughout both matches. Wales, on the other hand, have played some fine rugby and have made their best start since they last won the title in 1994. They also have a good record at the Stade de France, having won their first two games there, in 1999 and 2001. Wales have made two changes from the team that thrashed Italy 38-8 in Rome.\\n\\nKevin Morgan takes over from his injured Newport-Gwent Dragons colleague Hal Luscombe on the right wing. In the pack Neath-Swansea Ospreys forward Ryan Jones bas been brought on the blind-side flank to beef up the Wales back row in place of Jonathan Thomas. Wales coach Mike Ruddock is determined that his team will not go into their shells after their promising start to the championship. \"Graham Henry (former Wales coach) said a couple of years ago that we should \\'be bold\\' when going to France, and he was proved right,\" said Ruddock. \"That is a great way to approach the game, and something we will further endorse with the players this week.\"\\n\\nDespite their stuttering displays in their first two games defending champions France are also unbeaten. Under-pressure coach Bernard Laporte has made four changes, with Yannick Nyanga, the debutant Julien Laharrague, Aurelien Rougerie and Yannick Jauzion coming into the side. France have been criticised for the absence of traditional \"French flair\" as they have ground their way to victory so far this year but captain Fabien Pelous sees hope on the horizon. \"I get the impression we are getting better,\" he said. \"Against Wales, which is different from the teams we have beaten, I hope we can show our proper game.\"\\n\\nJ Laharrague; A Rougerie, Y Jauzion, D Traille, C Dominici; Y Delaigue, D Yachvili; S Marconnet, S Bruno, N Mas; F Pelous (capt), J Thion; S Betsen, Y Nyanga, J Bonnaire (Bourgoin).\\n\\nW Servat, O Milloud, G Lamboley, I Harinordoquy, P Mignoni, F Michalak, J-P Grandclaude.\\n\\nG Thomas (capt); K Morgan, T Shanklin, G Henson, S Williams; S Jones, D Peel; G Jenkins, M Davies, A Jones; B Cockbain, R Sidoli; R Jones, M Williams, M Owen.\\n\\nR McBryde, J Yapp, J Thomas, R Sowden-Taylor, G Cooper, C Sweeney, R Williams.\\nA November to remember\\n\\nLast Saturday, one newspaper proclaimed that England were still the number one side in the world.\\n\\nThat statement was made to look a little foolish by events later that afternoon at Twickenham. But it illustrated the wonderful unpredictability of Test rugby at the highest level, at the end of a richly entertaining autumn series. The final weekend threw the world pecking order into renewed confusion, with Australia\\'s triumph in London followed by France\\'s capitulation to New Zealand. \"Clearly, there is no number one side in the world at the moment,\" declared Wallabies coach Eddie Jones on arrival back in Sydney. \"There are four, five or probably six sides all competing at the same level and on any given day the difference between one side and another is only about 1%.\"\\n\\nWhile that bodes well for rugby as a whole, it also sharpens the sense of excitement ahead of what could be the most open Six Nations Championship for a decade. While the Wallabies, All Blacks and Springboks hit the beach before turning their attention to Super 12 matters in the new year, Europe\\'s finest have less than 10 weeks before they return to the international fray. And for the first time in more than a decade, it will not simply be a straightforward choice between England and France for the Six Nations title.\\n\\nThat owes much to Ireland\\'s continued progress and the belief that Wales are on the verge of delivering a major scalp to cement the promise of their autumn displays.\\n\\n, who secured a first Triple Crown in 19 years last season, could go one better and win their first Five/Six Nations title since 1985. They start with away games against Italy and Scotland, before England and France come to Lansdowne Road.\\n\\nTheir momentous victory over the Springboks can only bolster Ireland\\'s self-belief, while Ronan O\\'Gara\\'s late drop goal to deliver victory over Argentina was further proof that Eddie O\\'Sullivan\\'s side can now close out tight games. Not that England or France, who have won nine of the last 10 Six Nations titles between them, will lay down quietly.\\n\\ndismantling of the Springboks suggested that even after the loss of such influential figures as Martin Johnson and Lawrence Dallaglio, they still have the personnel to prosper.\\n\\nThe narrow defeat to Australia was a timely reminder that not everything is blooming in the red rose garden, but the fresh shoots of post-World Cup recovery have been sown by new head coach Andy Robinson. A fresh desire to regain former heights is evident, and if England emerge triumphant from an opening Six Nations engagement in Cardiff, a fourth title in six years is within reach.\\n\\nare in familiar revival territory, but this time it appears there is substance behind the rediscovered style.\\n\\nWhile South Africa\\'s over-confidence in Cardiff made for a closer scoreline than expected, Wales could legitimately claim to have had victory within their grasp against the All Blacks in one of the best Tests in recent memory. If Mike Ruddock can coax a reliable set-piece platform from his pack, there is no reason why victories should not ensue come February. The last fortnight has left\\n\\nin a state of bewilderment after an autumn series that began with a superb victory over Australia. A stunning defeat to Argentina, their first loss since the World Cup, could have been attributed to trademark French inconsistency.\\n\\nBut the manner of New Zealand\\'s 45-6 demolition job in Paris has coach Bernard Laporte bemoaning a lack of young talent coming through to replace the old guard. Fortunately for the French, the opening match of the Six Nations sees them entertaining\\n\\nin Paris. After two reasonable performances against Australia, the Scots\\' humbling by the Springboks forced coach Matt Williams to reassess his belief that a win over one of the major nations was imminent. While individuals such as Chris Cusiter and Ali Hogg enhanced their reputations, a lack of top-class players will continue to undermine their best efforts.\\n\\n, who start with home games against Ireland and Wales before travelling to Scotland, are also hopeful of registering more than one victory for the first time in the Championship. As autumn gives way to winter and the Heineken Cup prepares to resume centre stage meantime, the joy of Six will keep the home fires burning until February.\\nWilkinson targets Ireland\\n\\nJonny Wilkinson says he is \"massively positive\" about his chances of playing some part in the Six Nations.\\n\\nA knee injury has ruled him out of England\\'s first two matches against Wales and France, but he is hoping to feature against Ireland on 27 February. \"I\\'m coming on really well. The physios at England and Newcastle are as happy as they could possibly be at this point.\" said the England fly-half. Wilkinson has not played for England since their 2003 World Cup final win. \"The injury is to my left leg so, as a kicker, I need to make sure I\\'m really right so I can play my usual game.\"\\n\\n\"All I can do is try to get back. It (the knee injury) happened two and a half weeks ago and the limit was then set of six to eight weeks, which is the second half of the Six Nations.\" \"I\\'m just concentrating on doing my bit, which is the rehab. \"All I can do is free myself up for selection and then see what people want to do with me, whether they want to play me or leave it.\" If he does not recover in time for England\\'s Six Nations season, his next target would be the British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand. \"I\\'m looking to play first for Newcastle, then think about England and only then will I think about the Lions.\" he said. \"As with my other injuries, I\\'m taking it day by day.\"\\nIreland surge past Scots\\n\\nIreland maintained their Six Nations Grand Slam ambitions with an impressive victory over Scotland at Murrayfield.\\n\\nHugo Southwell\\'s try gave the Scots an early 8-0 lead but scores from locks Malcolm O\\'Kelly and Paul O\\'Connell put the visitors in command by half-time. A third try from wing Denis Hickie and third penalty from Ronan O\\'Gara, who kicked 13 points, extended the lead. Jon Petrie scored a second try for Scotland but late scores from John Hayes and Gavin Duffy sealed victory. After two hard-earned away victories, Eddie O\\'Sullivan\\' side can now look forward to welcoming England to Lansdowne Road in a fortnight. Scotland will try to give their coach Matt Williams a first Six Nations victory when Italy come to Edinburgh, but they again struggled to turn pressure into points. The home side started with tremendous intensity and dominated territory and possession in the opening 10 minutes. A powerful charge from flanker Jason White was carried on by Ali Hogg and when Ireland conceded a penalty close to their own line, Scotland kicked it to touch. The Irish defence foiled the home side on that occasion, but a stray hand in a ruck allowed Paterson to stroke over a penalty in the eighth minute.\\n\\nIf that was a paltry reward for their early pressure, Scotland got the try they deserved when Paterson\\'s searing break and Andy Craig\\'s pass sent Southwell streaking to the right corner. Paterson was off target with the conversion and fly-half Dan Parks then missed a presentable drop-goal attempt. Ireland got themselves on the scoreboard with an O\\'Gara penalty and by the 24th minute the visitors were ahead. Stuart Grimes pulled down O\\'Kelly at a line-out, Ireland kicked the penalty to touch and from the set-piece, the big lock was driven over by the rest of his pack.\\n\\nO\\'Gara added the conversion and a further penalty, after Shane Horgan almost grabbed a second try from O\\'Gara\\'s chip to the corner, only for the ball to spill from his hand. But Ireland still delivered a hammer blow to Scotland\\'s hopes just before the interval. O\\'Connell - skipper in the absence of Brian O\\'Driscoll - powered through Parks\\' weak tackle after a free-kick from a scrummage to burrow over.\\n\\nScotland suffered a further blow on the resumption when Ireland flanker Johnny O\\'Connor won another vital turnover, and O\\'Gara\\'s basketball pass sent Hickie over in the left corner. O\\'Gara converted and then thumped over a 40m penalty to give the visitors a commanding 28-8 advantage. Scotland looked bereft of ideas but a half-break from Paterson sparked them back to life just before the hour. Stuart Grimes won a line-out and a well-worked move saw Petrie scuttle round the side of the ruck to dive over in the left corner. But it proved a false dawn, and Ireland reasserted their authority in the final 10 minutes. Peter Stringer and O\\'Kelly combined to put giant prop Hayes over in the right corner before replacement Gavin Duffy scorched away on the left, David Humphreys adding the final flourish with a touchline conversion.\\n\\n: C Paterson; S Danielli, A Craig, H Southwell, S Lamont; D Parks, C Cusiter; T Smith, G Bulloch (capt), G Kerr; S Grimes, S Murray; J White, A Hogg, J Petrie.\\n\\nR Russell, B Douglas, N Hines, J Dunbar, M Blair, G Ross, B Hinshelwood.\\n\\nG Murphy; G Dempsey, S Horgan, K Maggs, D Hickie, R O\\'Gara, P Stringer; R Corrigan, S Byrne, J Hayes, M O\\'Kelly, P O\\'Connell, S Easterby, J O\\'Connor, A Foley.\\n\\nF Sheahan, M Horan, D O\\'Callaghan, E Miller, G Easterby, D Humphreys, G Duffy.\\n\\nJoel Jutge (France)\\nWales get Williams fitness boost\\n\\nWales are hopeful that openside flanker Martyn Williams could be fit for Saturday\\'s RBS 6 Nations championship opener against England in Cardiff.\\n\\nWilliams was expected to miss the match with a disc problem in his neck, but has been making a speedy recovery. \"He will have tests in the next 48 hours and we are pretty optimistic he is getting there,\" Wales\\' team physiotherapist Mark Davies said. \"It has been frustrating but he is on the mend, he has made good progress.\" Last week Williams, along with fellow flanker Colin Charvis - who is unlikely to play for at least a month while he recovers from a foot injury - was all but ruled out of the Millennium Stadium clash. With Williams initially thought to be struggling, the signs pointed towards Wales coach Mike Ruddock handing a first cap to former Wales Under-21 skipper Richie Pugh.\\n\\nCardiff Blues flanker Williams, 29, offers considerable experience and if he is declared fit then Ruddock might be tempted to include him in the back row. Charvis will be reviewed by the Wales medical staff next Monday, but Davies admitted that there was only an \"outside chance\" of him being fit to face France in Wales\\' third championship game on 26 February. Wales\\' other injury concern is Pugh\\'s fellow Neath-Swansea Ospreys player Sonny Parker, as the centre has a trapped nerve in his neck. \"Sonny\\'s injury is still an issue,\" Davies said. \"It is still painful and irritable. We will run the rule of thumb over him in the next couple of days.\" Ruddock will name his starting line-up for the England game at 1830 GMT on Tuesday evening, as Wales target their first victory in Cardiff over the world champions since 1993.\\nDavies favours Gloucester future\\n\\nWales hooker Mefin Davies is likely to stay with English side Gloucester despite reported interest from the Neath-Swansea Ospreys.\\n\\nBBC Wales understands the Ospreys are interested in the 32-year-old, but that he would prefer to stay where he is. Davies, one of the stars of Saturday\\'s RBS Six Nations win over England, is only on a year contract at Kingsholm. But the hooker has proved his worth to the Zurich Premiership side and is likely to get a new deal next season. The summer demise of the Celtic Warriors region left Davies in the cold and forced him to take a semi-professional contract with Neath RFC. Although he got match time with the Ospreys at the request of the Wales management, he admitted before his move to Gloucester that he was angry with the way he was treated. \"The WRU didn\\'t give me any help off the field, it was very disappointing,\" Davies said at the time. \"It was a hard time throughout the summer, then deciding whether to accept an offer from Stade Francais which would have ended my Wales career.\"\\nBell set for England debut\\n\\nBath prop Duncan Bell has been added to England\\'s 30-man squad to face Ireland in the RBS Six Nations.\\n\\nAnd with Phil Vickery sidelined for at least six weeks with a broken arm and Julian White out with a neck injury, Bell could make his England debut. Bell, 30, had set his sights on an international career with Wales. But last December, the International Rugby Board confirmed that he could only be eligible for England as he had travelled on tour with them in 1998. England coach Andy Robinson could take a gamble and call inexperienced Sale Sharks prop Andrew Sheridan into his front row. But Sheridan favours the loosehead side of the scrum and a more likely scenario is for uncapped Bell - who was among the tryscorers when England A beat France A 30-20 nine days ago - to be drafted in. Robinson also has an injury worry over centre Olly Barkley, who withdrew from Bath\\'s starting line-up to face Gloucester last weekend.\\n\\nHe was due to have a hospital scan on Monday, while Gloucester centre Henry Paul, who started at fly-half against Bath, limped out at Kingsholm because of an ankle problem. Despite Barkley\\'s three missed penalties in the 18-17 defeat against France, he is expected to retain his place at inside centre, although Leicester\\'s in-form prospect Ollie Smith would be an obvious replacement. Bath coach John Connolly rates Barkley as no better than a 50/50 chance to make the Dublin trip. Uncapped fly-half Andy Goode has been named in a 30-man training squad for the Ireland game, and he strengthened his selection claims by kicking 28 points during Leicester\\'s record 83-10 win against Newcastle on Sunday. England\\'s players are due to meet at their Surrey training base on Monday.\\nVickery out of Six Nations\\n\\nEngland tight-head prop Phil Vickery has been ruled out of the rest of the 2005 RBS Six Nations after breaking a bone in his right forearm.\\n\\nVickery was injured as his club side, Gloucester, beat Bath 17-16 in the West country derby on Saturday. He could be joined on the sidelines by Bath centre Olly Barkley, who sat out the derby due to a leg injury. Barkley will have a scan on Sunday and might miss England\\'s trip to Six Nations leaders Ireland next weekend. The news is just the latest blow for coach Andy Robinson, who has seen his side lose their opening two matches in the 2005 Six Nations. Robinson is already without World Cup winners Jonny Wilkinson, Will Greenwood, Mike Tindall, Richard Hill and Trevor Woodman through injury. Vickery has broken the radius, a large bone in his forearm. He only returned to the England side last weekend after a long-term back injury, which was followed by a fractured eye socket. And the Gloucester prop was only recalled after Leicester tight-head Julian White suffered a neck injury which has already seen him ruled out of the Ireland game.\\n\\nBath prop Matt Stevens is the only remaining tight-head in England\\'s training squad and could be involved against Ireland. But he has to play second fiddle at club level to Duncan Bell, who excelled for England A against France and may now be called into the squad. The extent of Barkley\\'s injury is not yet clear but Bath boss John Connolly rates him no better than \"50-50\" to face Ireland. Barkley played at inside cente in England\\'s defeat by France and if he is unable to play, England\\'s constantly-changing midfield will once again have to be altered.\\n\\nRobinson could choose to recall Mathew Tait or Henry Paul, although Tait endured a nightmare for Newcastle against Leicester on Saturday and Paul limped off with an ankle injury against Bath. In-form Leicester centre Ollie Smith is the other outstanding candidate, and two tries against Newcastle will have boosted his chances. Fly-half Andy Goode is also a strong contender for the match-day 22 after an immaculate kicking display on Saturday. England, fourth in the Six Nations table with zero points, play Ireland, top of the table, in Dublin on 27 February, kick-off 1500 GMT.\\nLlewellyn plans Wales retirement\\n\\nWales record cap holder Gareth Llewellyn will retire from Test rugby at the end of the Six Nations.\\n\\nThe veteran lock, who is 36 at the end of February, told BBC Wales Scrum V that it is time for him to bring down the curtain on his 92-cap Wales career. Llewellyn is on a one-season deal with French club side Narbonne, but said he may consider retiring from all rugby. \"I don\\'t know what I\\'ll do next year, whether to carry on playing or make a change in my career,\" Llewellyn said. \"Narbonne are really keen for me to stay on for next year, so I\\'ve got to decide whether to stay on there or maybe go somewhere else, but ultimitely coaching is where I\\'d like to end up. \"I\\'ve done all the coaching awards and everything you can do in that respect, so it\\'s just hopefully getting a chance somewhere.\" Fellow locks Robert Sidoli and Brent Cockbain, who both scored tries in Saturday\\'s Six Nations win in Italy, are Wales coach Mike Ruddock\\'s preferred starters in the second row.\\n\\nWith the resurgence of the Dragons\\' Ian Gough and the adaptibility of lock-cum-flanker Jon Thomas on the bench, Llewellyn has not yet made a match-day squad this Six Nations campaign. But the former Neath and Ospreys player is still targetting one last outing in the red shirt. \"If I do get on the field then brilliant, although the boys are doing really well and I\\'m very pleased for them,\" Llewellyn added. \"We\\'ve had some really tough years in Wales and the players have been through a hell of a lot. \"Sometimes the easiest thing would have been to throw the towel in and walk away, but a few of us dug in there and it\\'s really nice to see some of the boys getting the rewards now. \"I was going to retire at the end of the last Six Nations, I\\'d even told some of the boys in the squad about it. \"But Mike (Ruddock) asked me to carry on for another season, which I\\'ve done, still part of the squad, still trying to help them out as much as I can.\" Llewellyn made his Wales debut in 1989 against New Zealand as a 20-year-old, having caught the selectors\\' eyes in the All Blacks\\' tour match against Neath. The 6ft 6in player has not looked back since, going on to break Neil Jenkins\\' Wales cap record on 12 June 2004 in the 50-44 loss in Argentina.\\n\\n\"There\\'s been lots of highs - winning the Six Nations in \\'94, beating England in \\'93, I\\'ve been on some great tours and seen some fantastic countries,\" Llewellyn said. \"But I think the best thing of all for me was the time I spent with the players, I\\'ve met some great guys in rugby and made some great friends. \"It\\'ll be a bit strange on international days having to find somewhere to watch Wales play, but at least I might have time to get my golf handicap down!\" Llewellyn captained Neath for seven seasons, while being an integral part of the Neath-Swansea Ospreys regional side\\'s first season. But with the Ospreys building for the future, Llewellyn was eventually forced to look to France for employment - digging in his heels during contract negotiations to insist he must be allowed to play for Wales.\\nEngland 17-18 France\\n\\nEngland suffered an eighth defeat in 11 Tests as scrum-half Dimitri Yachvili booted France to victory at Twickenham.\\n\\nTwo converted tries from Olly Barkley and Josh Lewsey helped the world champions to a 17-6 half-time lead. But Charlie Hodgson and Barkley missed six penalties between them, while Yachvili landed six for France to put the visitors in front. England could have won the game with three minutes left, but Hodgson pushed an easy drop goal opportunity wide. It was a dismal defeat for England, coming hard on the heels of an opening Six Nations loss in Wales. They should have put the game well beyond France\\'s reach, but remarkably remained scoreless for the entire second half. A scrappy opening quarter saw both sides betray the lack of confidence engendered by poor opening displays against Wales and Scotland respectively. Hodgson had an early opportunity to settle English nerves but pushed a straightforward penalty attempt wide. But a probing kick from France centre Damien Traille saw Mark Cueto penalised for holding on to the ball in the tackle, Yachvili giving France the lead with a kick from wide out.\\n\\nFrance twice turned over England ball at the breakdown early on as the home side struggled to generate forward momentum, one Ben Kay charge apart. A spell of tit-for-tat kicking emphasised the caution on both sides, until England refused a possible three points to kick a penalty to the corner, only to botch the subsequent line-out. But England made the breakthrough after 19 minutes, when a faltering move off the back of a scrum led to the opening try. Jamie Noon took a short pass from Barkley and ran a good angle to plough through Yann Delaigue\\'s flimsy tackle before sending his centre partner through to score at the posts.\\n\\nHodgson converted and added a penalty after one of several French infringements on the floor for a 10-3 lead. The fly-half failed to dispense punishment though with a scuffed attempt after France full-back Pepito Elhorga, scragged by Lewsey, threw the ball into touch. Barkley also missed two longer-range efforts as the first half drew to a close, but by then England had scored a second converted try. After a series of phases lock Danny Grewcock ran hard at the French defence and off-loaded out of Sylvain Marconnet\\'s tackle to Lewsey. The industrious wing cut back in on an angle and handed off hooker Sebastien Bruno to sprint over. After a dire opening to the second half, France threw on three forward replacements in an attempt to rectify the situation, wing Jimmy Marlu having already departed injured. Yachvili nibbled away at the lead with a third penalty after 51 minutes.\\n\\nAnd when Lewis Moody was twice penalised - for handling in a ruck and then straying offside - the scrum-half\\'s unerring left boot cut the deficit to two points. Barkley then missed his third long-range effort to increase the tension. And after seeing another attempt drop just short, Yachvili put France ahead with his sixth penalty with 11 minutes left.\\n\\nEngland sent on Ben Cohen and Matt Dawson, and after Barkley\\'s kick saw Christophe Dominici take the ball over his own line, the stage was set for a victory platform. But even after a poor scrummage, Hodgson had the chance to seal victory but pushed his drop-goal attempt wide. England threw everything at the French in the final frantic moments, but the visitors held on for their first win at Twickenham since 1997.\\n\\nJ Robinson (capt); M Cueto, J Noon, O Barkley, J Lewsey; C Hodgson, H Ellis; G Rowntree, S Thompson, P Vickery; D Grewcock, B Kay; J Worsley, L Moody, M Corry.\\n\\nA Titterrell, A Sheridan, S Borthwick, A Hazell, M Dawson, H Paul, B Cohen.\\n\\nP Elhorga; C Dominici, B Liebenberg, D Traille, J Marlu; Y Delaigue, D Yachvili; S Marconnet, S Bruno, N Mas; F Pelous (capt), J Thion, S Betsen, J Bonnaire, S Chabal.\\n\\nW Servat, J Milloud, G Lamboley, Y Nyanga, P Mignoni, F Michalak, J-P Grandclaude.\\n\\nPaddy O\\'Brien (New Zealand)\\nPountney handed ban and fine\\n\\nNorthampton coach Budge Pountney has been fined £2,000 and banned from match-day coaching for six weeks for calling a referee \"a disgrace\".\\n\\nPountney was found guilty of bringing the game into disrepute at a Rugby Football Union disciplinary hearing in London on Thursday night. Pountney criticised referee Steve Lander\\'s performance in Northampton\\'s defeat by Saracens on 5 February. The last two weeks of the six-week ban are suspended. Pountney pleaded guilty to the offence before a panel consisting of chairman Robert Horner, Nigel Gillingham and Jeff Probyn. The ban means former Scotland international Pountney cannot enter the playing enclosure, technical areas or go near the touchline, tunnel or players and officials\\' areas on the day of a game.\\nTigers wary of Farrell \\'gamble\\'\\n\\nLeicester say they will not be rushed into making a bid for Andy Farrell should the Great Britain rugby league captain decide to switch codes.\\n\\n\"We and anybody else involved in the process are still some way away from going to the next stage,\" Tigers boss John Wells told BBC Radio Leicester. \"At the moment, there are still a lot of unknowns about Andy Farrell, not least his medical situation. \"Whoever does take him on is going to take a big, big gamble.\" Farrell, who has had persistent knee problems, had an operation on his knee five weeks ago and is expected to be out for another three months. Leicester and Saracens are believed to head the list of rugby union clubs interested in signing Farrell if he decides to move to the 15-man game.\\n\\nIf he does move across to union, Wells believes he would better off playing in the backs, at least initially. \"I\\'m sure he could make the step between league and union by being involved in the centre,\" said Wells. \"I think England would prefer him to progress to a position in the back row where they can make use of some of his rugby league skills within the forwards. \"The jury is out on whether he can cross that divide. \"At this club, the balance will have to be struck between the cost of that gamble and the option of bringing in a ready-made replacement.\"\\nBath faced with Tindall ultimatum\\n\\nMike Tindall\\'s agent has warned Bath they have until next week to improve their contract offer to the England man or risk losing him to a rival club.\\n\\nDipo Alli says he has received an offer for Tindall which dwarfs Bath\\'s deal and that two other clubs want to talk. \"Mike does not want to go into the Six Nations worrying about where he will be playing his club rugby next season,\" Alli told the Guardian newspaper. \"It is up to (Bath owner) Andrew Brownsword. He has to make it happen.\" Tindall is out of contract at the end of the season but it is understood that Brownsword is unwilling to break the club\\'s salary structure to accommodate the 26-year-old\\'s demands. But Alli insists the player is worth more than Bath have put on the table. \"Mike has been at Bath for eight years and wants to remain with the club and his demands are anything but excessive,\" the agent added. \"But Brownsword has to recognise Mike\\'s value and we want to resolve things by the end of next week.\"\\nLewsey puzzle over disallowed try\\n\\nEngland\\'s Josh Lewsey has claimed he was denied a late try in his side\\'s Six Nations loss to Ireland.\\n\\nThe Wasps wing insisted he grounded the ball when he was bundled over the line and said referee Jonathan Kaplan had made a wrong decision. \"I\\'m positive I touched the ball down over the line,\" Lewsey told BBC Sport. \"It certainly wasn\\'t a turnover. \"I was driven over and I put the ball on the ground. The whistle went and I let go of the ball.\" Lewsey added: \"One of the Irish players scooped it back after the whistle and to our surprise the referee then gave a turnover. \"As far as I\\'m concerned, that incident and Mark Cueto\\'s effort from Charlie Hodgson\\'s cross-field kick that led to what looked like a good try were the two key elements in the game.\"\\n\\nCueto was also puzzled as to why his try had been disallowed by Kaplan. \"I don\\'t think I could have been offside for, without a doubt, I was behind the ball,\" said the Sale player. \"The move was a planned technique, it was not off the cuff. We rehearse it time and time again. \"I wouldn\\'t say we were robbed, some decisions go with you and some go against you. Today they went against us and that\\'s tough at international level.\"\\nSydney to host north v south game\\n\\nSydney will host a northern versus southern hemisphere charity match in June or July, the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) said on Wednesday.\\n\\nThe match will include players from the Lions tour of New Zealand. \"The Australian Rugby Union has thrown its support behind a proposed North-South match to raise funds for the tsunami appeals,\" the ARU said. The date is yet to be decided but the most likely venue is Sydney\\'s Olympic Stadium. ARU chief executive Gary Flowers said the world cricket charity match in Melbourne earlier this month had inspired the ARU. \"We still need to discuss the options with the IRB (International Rugby Board), the Lions and our SANZAR (South Africa, New Zealand and Australia Rugby) partners, but June or July is seen as a better option than March to ensure we have the cream of southern hemisphere rugby available,\" he said. Wallabies captain George Gregan said the charity match was a \"great initiative\". Tri-Nations rivals Australia, New Zealand and South Africa would feature prominently in a southern team against a northern side comprised of Six Nations teams France, Ireland, England, Wales, Italy and Scotland. Coach Clive Woodward\\'s Lions squad will tour New Zealand in June and July, including Tests on 25 June, 2 and 9 July.\\n\\nAlmost 80,000 fans packed into Melbourne Cricket Ground on 10 January for a charity match that raised £5.9m for victims of the Asian tsunami.\\nItaly 17-28 Ireland\\n\\nTwo moments of magic from Brian O\\'Driscoll guided Ireland to a workmanlike victory against Italy.\\n\\nA pair of classic outside breaks from the Ireland captain set up tries for Geordan Murphy and Peter Stringer. Italy led 9-8 early in the second half but Stringer\\'s try gave Ireland a lead they never lost. The hosts cut the gap to 18-12 with 10 minutes left and nearly scored through Ludovico Nitoglia, but Denis Hickie\\'s try ensured an Irish victory. Italy came flying out of the blocks and took the lead through a Luciano Orquera penalty after seven minutes.\\n\\nIt could have been better for the hosts but the fly-half missed two kickable penalties and Ireland drew level with a Ronan O\\'Gara penalty midway through the first half. The Italians were driving at the heart of the Irish defence and, for the first quarter, the Irish pack struggled to secure any ball for their talented backs.\\n\\nWhen they finally did, just before the half-hour mark, O\\'Driscoll promptly created a sparkling try for Murphy. The Ireland captain ran a dummy scissors and made a magical outside break before drawing the full-back and putting the diving Murphy in at the corner. O\\'Gara missed the twice-taken conversion and the visitors found themselves trailing once again. Roland de Marigny took over the kicking duties for Italy from the hapless Orquera, and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge Italy into a 9-8 lead.\\n\\nThe only Ireland player offering a real threat was O\\'Driscoll, and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors. Shane Horgan threw an overhead pass as he was about to be forced into touch and Stringer scooted over, with O\\'Gara landing the tricky conversion. A penalty apiece saw Ireland leading 18-12 as the game entered the final quarter, but they were lucky to survive when Italy launched a series of attacks. Winger Nitoglia dropped the ball as he reached for the line and Italy nearly rumbled over from a driving maul.\\n\\nAn O\\'Gara penalty put Ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when Hickie latched onto an inside pass from Murphy and crossed for a converted try. O\\'Driscoll limped off late on, joining centre partner Gordon D\\'Arcy on the sidelines, and the final word went to Italy. Prop Martin Castrogiovanni powered over for a try which was fitting reward for an Italian pack which had kept the Irish under pressure throughout.\\n\\nDe Marigny; Mi Bergamasco, Canale, Masi, Nitoglia; Orquera, Troncon; Lo Cicero, Ongaro, Castrogiovanni; Dellape, Bortolami; Persico, Ma Bergamasco, Parisse.\\n\\nPerugini, Intoppa, Del Fava, Dal Maso, Griffen, Pozzebon, Robertson.\\n\\nMurphy, Horgan, O\\'Driscoll, D\\'Arcy, Hickie, O\\'Gara, Stringer, Corrigan, Byrne, Hayes, O\\'Kelly, O\\'Connell, S Easterby, Leamy, Foley.\\n\\nSheahan, Horan, O\\'Callaghan, Miller, G Easterby, Humphreys, Dempsey.\\n\\nP O\\'Brien (New Zealand)\\nKafer resigns as Saracens coach\\n\\nSaracens head coach Rod Kafer has resigned from the Premiership club.\\n\\nThe 33-year-old Australian, who replaced Wayne Shelford in August 2003, has decided to stand down after a disappointing start to the season. Saracens have decided to promote from within, with rugby manager Steve Diamond named as Kafer\\'s replacement. \"Following talks about extending my contract, I came to the conclusion that my preference was to seek opportunities elsewhere,\" Kafer said. \"In light of this, chief executive Mark Sinderberry and I have decided that it is in the club\\'s best interests that I stand down as head coach immediately. \"I would like to thank both Mark and the board of directors for their unwavering support during the last 18 months and wish the playing and management staff all the best for the remainder of the season.\" Kafer, who was part of the Australia team that won the World Cup in 1999, has been linked with a move to the new Perth-based Super 14 side. Saracens, the perennial under-achievers in the Premiership, have had a poor start to the season with only four victories in the first 11 league games.\\n\\nDespite finishing third from bottom last season, hopes were high for this campaign but they are currently eighth in the table. However the news of Kafer\\'s decision comes just two days after their convincing 52-6 victory over Parma in the European Challenge Cup. Sinderberry said: \"On behalf of the board of directors, I would like to thank Rod for his efforts over the past 18 months. \"He took over the club at a difficult time and he leaves us in a better position with a more focused coaching and playing structure.\" Diamond is the latest man to be charged with winning Saracens\\' first trophy since the 1998 Tetley\\'s Bitter Cup. He joined the club back in March after a successful three years with Sale.\\n\\nTogether with Jim Mallinder, Diamond steered the club to second in the Premiership as well as Parker Pen Shield glory. \"Steve will now take on the role of head coach and will be supported by the existing coaching staff,\" said Sinderberry. \"When Steve was appointed, it was with a view that he would succeed Rod should he take the decision to leave Saracens. \"Steve knows the club and the players and we believe he is the right person to take the role.\"\\nWales win in Rome\\n\\nWales secured their first away win in the RBS Six Nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in Rome.\\n\\nTries from Jonathan Thomas, Tom Shanklin and Martyn Williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. Luciano Orquera did reply with one for Italy but second-half efforts from Brent Cockbain, Shane Williams and Robert Sidoli sealed victory. Fly-half Stephen Jones added four conversions as Wales maintained their superb start to this year\\'s tournament. Starting full of confidence after their victory over England, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. Diminutive wing Shane Williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing Andrea Masi and Aaron Persico into the Italian half. His pass to Tom Shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and Michael Owen\\'s long cut-out pass gave the lurking Thomas an easy run-in.\\n\\nStephen Jones, who retained the kicking duties despite Gavin Henson\\'s heroics against England, slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. Wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and Italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.\\n\\nHenson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for England, beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. But his attempted chip ahead was charged down by Orquera, who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. With the Welsh line-out stuttering and Italy twice turning the visitors\\' scrum, the home side\\'s forward power brought them back into it. But a clever high kick from Henson almost brought a try for Hal Luscombe when Roland de Marigny and Ludovico Nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.\\n\\nWales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try. Jones was unable to convert and De Marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for Italy. Henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal, but Wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.\\n\\nHenson sent Luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to Martyn Williams, the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post, Jones adding the conversion. Italy, who lost flanker Mauro Bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. De Marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a Nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. But Wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. Their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from Shane Williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock Cockbain. Before Italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from Gareth Thomas and great off-loads from Martyn Williams and replacement Kevin Morgan saw Shane Williams scamper over.\\n\\nWith Jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, Wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. The icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work, Shane Williams and Ceri Sweeney combining to send Sidoli over in the left corner. The only downside for Wales was a hamstring injury suffered by Luscombe. But after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years, they will travel to Paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders.\\n\\nR de Marigny; Mirco Bergamasco, W Pozzebon, A Masi, L Nitoglia; L Orquera, A Troncon; A Lo Cicero, F Ongaro, M Castrogiovanni, S Dellape, M Bortolami (capt), A Persico, Mauro Bergamasco, S Parisse.\\n\\nG Intoppa, S Perugini, CA del Fava, D dal Maso, P Griffen, M Barbini, KP Robertson.\\n\\nG Thomas (capt); H Luscombe, T Shanklin, G Henson, S Williams; S Jones, D Peel; G Jenkins, M Davies, A Jones; B Cockbain, R Sidoli; J Thomas, M Williams, M Owen.\\n\\nR McBryde, J Yapp, I Gough, R Sowden-Taylor, G Cooper, C Sweeney, K Morgan.\\n\\nAndrew Cole (Australia).\\nFarrell saga to drag on - Lindsay\\n\\nWigan chairman Maurice Lindsay says he does not expect a quick solution to the on-going saga of captain Andy Farrell\\'s possible switch to rugby union.\\n\\nLeicester and Saracens are leading the chase for the player, but Lindsay told the BBC it was not yet a done deal. \"As well as the Rugby Football Union, the league, the individual club and the England coaching team have a say, so it\\'s not a quick decision,\" he said. \"He\\'s given us 12 years service so if he wants to go, we\\'d support him.\" The prospect of Farrell switching codes has been the main talking point of the Super League season so far. \"It came as a bolt out of the blue to us,\" admitted Lindsay. \"But he\\'s a very loyal friend to the club, so there\\'s no question that he\\'s deserting us. He just fancies a challenge.\"\\n\\nAlthough the move would be a lucrative one for both Farrell and Wigan, Lindsay said money was not a motivating factor for the club. \"The money side of things hasn\\'t been concluded, but it\\'s not the point for Wigan,\" he told Radio Five Live. \"A shortage of money has never been a problem for us. \"Even if we did have it, under the salary cap we can\\'t spend a penny of it anyway - we\\'d rather have the player.\"\\n\\nLindsay also said he understood why rugby union was so interested in signing up Farrell. \"It\\'d be a great loss for us but a great boost for them,\" said the Warriors chief. \"This guy is an absolute sporting icon. He\\'s been at the top for so long and has demonstrated so many attributes that you need to make it in a tough contact sport. \"Athletes like him - Ellery Hanley and Martin Johnson - don\\'t come along very often. You\\'re very lucky to have them whilst you\\'ve got them.\"\\nEngland given tough Sevens draw\\n\\nEngland will have to negotiate their way through a tough draw if they are to win the Rugby World Cup Sevens in Hong Kong next month.\\n\\nThe second seeds have been drawn against Samoa, France, Italy, Georgia and Chinese Taipei. The top two sides in each pool qualify but England could face 2001 winners New Zealand in the quarter-finals if they stumble against Samoa. Scotland and Ireland are in Pool A together with the All Blacks. England won the first event of the International Rugby Board World Sevens series in Dubai but have slipped to fourth in the table after failing to build on that victory.\\n\\nHowever, they beat Samoa in the recent Los Angeles Sevens before losing to Argentina in the semi-finals. \"England have the ability and determination to win this World Cup and create sporting history by being the only nation to hold both the 15s and Sevens World Cups at the same time,\" said England sevens coach Mike Friday. \"England have a fantastic record in Hong Kong and have won there the last three years, but the World Cup is on a different level. \"Every pool contains teams who have caused upsets before and we will have to work hard to ensure we progress from our group. \"We have not performed consistently to our true potential so far in the IRB Sevens which has been disappointing - but we can only look forward.\" England won the first Rugby World Cup Sevens in 1993 with a side that included the likes of Lawrence Dallaglio and Matt Dawson. In 1997 and 2001, England lost in the quarter-finals.\\n\\n(seeds in brackets)\\n\\nNew Zealand (1), Scotland (8), Tonga, Ireland, Korea, USA.\\n\\nEngland (2), Samoa (7), France, Italy, Georgia, Chinese Taipei.\\n\\nFiji (3), Australia (6), Canada, Portugal, Japan, Hong Kong.\\n\\nArgentina (4), South Africa (5), Kenya, Tunisia, Russia, Uruguay.\\nScots suffer another injury blow\\n\\nScotland\\'s back row crisis has worsened ahead of the RBS Six Nations with news that Scott Gray will miss out on the opening matches.\\n\\nThe Borders flanker has a knee injury and joins Donnie Macfadyen and Allister Hogg on the sidelines. Star number eight Simon Taylor will miss at least the first two games after damaging an ankle during his comeback. Scott MacLeod (ankle ligaments) and Jon Petrie (cartilage) are also doubtful for the opener in Paris on 5 February. Gray, 26, who won his first cap against Australia at Murrayfield last year, was hurt in club action at the weekend. Scotland doctor James Robson said: \"A scan has shown damage to the medial ligaments of Scott\\'s right knee ruling him out of the first part of the Championship. \"We will seek further specialist advice in due course to determine just how long Scott may be out for.\" Another potential option, Glasgow flanker Andrew Wilson, has been ruled out for a month after damaging ligaments in both knees against Northampton recently.\\n\\nFlanker Jason White and prop Tom Smith have also been suffering from flu and missed this week\\'s training sessions. \"We have got plenty of good, young players coming through and we have got to look at the opportunities it represents for them, rather than the negatives,\" Williams added. Williams could now turn to Edinburgh pair Alasdair Strokosch and Simon Cross. Leeds Tykes flanker Jon Dunbar also trained with the squad but is still awaiting verification of his eligibility to qualify for Scotland.\\nTaylor poised for Scotland return\\n\\nSimon Taylor has been named in the Scotland squad for Saturday\\'s Six Nations clash with Italy.\\n\\nThe 25-year-old number eight made a scoring return for Edinburgh at the weekend - his first game in a year for the capital side. Taylor suffered knee ligament damage playing against Ireland in Dublin in the 2004 Six Nations championship. \"Simon is one of Scotland\\'s truly world class players so it is a huge bonus,\" said team-mate Chris Paterson. \"He brings a whole new dimension to us, especially in defence and his ability to slow the opposition ball down could be key against Italy if he is involved.\" Taylor has turned out for English side Saracens in recent weeks during a short-term loan to improve his fitness.\\n\\nEdinburgh were not in action during the first two weeks of this season\\'s Six Nations. So Taylor played the last 20 minutes of Saracens\\' win over Northampton and then 40 minutes in a friendly against South African Super 12 side The Cats. Scotland coach Matt Williams is due to name his match-day 22 on Thursday. Both Scotland and Italy have lost their opening two Six Nations games and, just like last season\\'s encounter which Italy won, this weekend\\'s game could turn out to be a battle to avoid the wooden spoon.\\n\\n- M Blair (Edinburgh), A Craig (Glasgow), C Cusiter (Borders), S Danielli (Borders), M Di Rollo (Edinburgh), A Henderson (Glasgow), B Hinshelwood (Worcester), R Lamont (Glasgow), S Lamont (Glasgow), D Parks (Glasgow), C Paterson (Edinburgh), G Ross (Leeds), H Southwell (Edinburgh), S Webster (Edinburgh)\\n\\n- R Beattie (Northampton), G Bulloch (Glasgow, capt), B Douglas (Borders), J Dunbar (Leeds), I Fullarton (Saracens), S Grimes (Newcastle), N Hines (Edinburgh), A Hogg (Edinburgh), G Kerr (Leeds), N Lloyd (Saracens), S Murray (Edinburgh), J Petrie (Glasgow), R Russell (London Irish), C Smith (Edinburgh), T Smith (Northampton), S Taylor (Edinburgh), J White (Sale).\\nIreland call up uncapped Campbell\\n\\nUlster scrum-half Kieran Campbell is one of five uncapped players included in Ireland\\'s RBS Six Nations squad.\\n\\nCampbell is joined by Ulster colleagues Roger Wilson and Ronan McCormack along with Connacht\\'s Bernard Jackman and Munster\\'s Shaun Payne. Gordon D\\'Arcy is back after injury while Munster flanker Alan Quinlan also returns to international consideration. \"The squad is selected purely on form. A lot of players put their hands up,\" coach Eddie O\\'Sullivan told BBC Sport. \"Kieran Campbell was just one of those players. He has been playing very well in the Heineken Cup and deserves his call-up. \"There is big competition in some departments and not so much in others. There were one or two players who were unfortunate just to miss out.\" Back-row forwards David Wallace and Victor Costello are omitted, with O\\'Sullivan having Quinlan, Wilson, Simon Easterby, Anthony Foley, Denis Leamy and Johnny O\\'Connor vying for the three positions.\\n\\nWith David Humphreys, Kevin Maggs, Simon Best and Tommy Bowe again included, it is Ulster\\'s biggest representation in a training panel for quite some time. Munster and Leinster have 12 and 11 players in the squad respectively while Jackman is the sole Connacht representative. Four British-based players are also included. Ulster forward Ronan McCormack said he was \"totally shocked\" to be included. \"I\\'m really looking forward to it,\" said McCormack. \"I played with guys like Brian O\\'Driscoll and Denis Hickie back in my school days in Leinster so I do know a few of them although not that well. \"It will be great to work with them.\"\\n\\nS Best (Ulster), S Byrne (Leinster), R Corrigan (Leinster), L Cullen (Leinster), S Easterby (Llanelli), A Foley (Munster), J Hayes (Munster), M Horan (Munster), B Jackman (Connacht), D Leamy (Munster), E Miller (Leinster), R McCormack (Ulster), D O\\'Callaghan (Munster), P O\\'Connell (Munster), J O\\'Connor (Wasps), M O\\'Kelly (Leinster), F Sheahan (Munster), R Wilson (Ulster), A Quinlan (Munster).\\n\\nT Bowe (Ulster), K Campbell (Ulster), G D\\'Arcy (Ulster), G Dempsey (Leinster), G Duffy (Harlequins), G Easterby (Leinster), D Hickie (Leinster), A Horgan (Munster), S Horgan (Leinster), D Humphreys (Ulster), K Maggs (Ulster), G Murphy (Leicester), B O\\'Driscoll, (Leinster), R O\\'Gara (Munster), S Payne (Munster), P Stringer (Munster).\\n\\nK Gleeson (Leinster), T Howe (Ulster), J Kelly (Munster), N McMillan (Ulster).\\nO\\'Connor aims to grab opportunity\\n\\nJohnny O\\'Connor is determined to make a big impression when he makes his RBS Six Nations debut for Ireland against Scotland on Saturday.\\n\\nThe Wasps flanker replaces Denis Leamy but O\\'Connor knows that the Munster man will be pushing hard for a recall for the following game against England. \"It\\'s a \\'horses for courses\\' selection really,\" said O\\'Connor. \"There\\'s a lot of competition here and I can\\'t just drag my heels around if I don\\'t get picked.\" It looks a definite head-to-head battle between himself and 23-year-old Leamy - three stone heavier than O\\'Connor - for the number seven role against the world champions. Nonetheless, all O\\'Connor is currently concerned about is making an impression while winning his third cap.\\n\\n\"Missing the Italian game was disappointing certainly, but you can\\'t dwell on these things - it\\'s part and parcel of rugby. \"Denis has been playing really well and deserved his opportunity. \"It\\'s a good situation to be in if there are good players around you, pushing for a place in the side.\" O\\'Connor, who celebrated his 25th birthday on Wednesday, was touted by Wasps director of rugby Warren Gatland as a possible 2005 Lions Test openside as far back as last September. And his reputation as a breakdown scavenger and heavy hitter has seen him come to the forefront of O\\'Sullivan\\'s mind for the Scottish tussle. O\\'Connor added: \"It will be interesting to see how situations on the deck is reffed, with the new laws having come in.\\n\\n\"Obviously the breakdown a big part of what I do on the pitch so I\\'m hoping to hold some influence there against what is a very solid Scottish pack.\" O\\'Connor will be winning his third cap after making his debut in the victory over South Africa last November.\\nFuming Robinson blasts officials\\n\\nEngland coach Andy Robinson said he was \"livid\" after his side were denied two tries in Sunday\\'s 19-13 Six Nations loss to Ireland in Dublin.\\n\\nMark Cueto\\'s first-half effort was ruled out for offside before the referee spurned TV replays when England crashed over in the dying minutes. \"[I\\'m] absolutely spitting. I\\'m livid. There\\'s two tries we\\'ve been cost,\" Robinson told BBC Sport. \"We\\'ve got to go back to technology. I don\\'t know why we didn\\'t.\" South African referee Jonathan Kaplan ruled that Cueto was ahead of Charlie Hodgson when the fly-half hoisted his cross-field kick for the Sale wing to gather.\\n\\nKaplan then declined the chance to consult the fourth official when Josh Lewsey took the ball over the Irish line under a pile of bodies for what could have been the game-winning try. \"I think Mark Cueto scored a perfectly legal try and I think he should have gone to the video referee on Josh Lewsey,\" said Robinson. \"It is how we use the technology. It is there, and it should be used.\\n\\n\"I am still trying to work out the Cueto try. I have looked at both, and they both looked tries. \"We are very disappointed, and this will hurt, there is no doubt about that. \"We are upset now, but the referee is in charge and he has called it his way and we have got to be able to cope with that.\\n\\n\"We did everything we could have done to win the game. I am very proud of my players and, with a couple of decisions, this could have been a very famous victory. \"I thought we dominated. Matt Stevens had an awesome game at tighthead prop, while the likes of Charlie Hodgson, Martin Corry and Lewis Moody all came through well. \"Josh Lewsey was awesome, and every one of the forwards stood up out there. Given the pressure we were under, credit must go to all the players. \"We have done everything but win a game of rugby, but Ireland are a good side. They defended magnificently and they\\'ve got every chance of winning this Six Nations.\" England have lost their first three matches in this year\\'s Six Nations and four out of their six games since Robinson took over from Sir Clive Woodward in September.\\nHarinordoquy suffers France axe\\n\\nNumber eight Imanol Harinordoquy has been dropped from France\\'s squad for the Six Nations match with Ireland in Dublin on 12 March.\\n\\nHarinordoquy was a second-half replacement in last Saturday\\'s 24-18 defeat to Wales. Bourgoin lock Pascal Pape, who has recovered from a sprained ankle, returns to the 22-man squad. Wing Cedric Heymans and Ludovic Valbon come in for Aurelien Rougerie and Jean-Philippe Grandclaude.\\n\\nRougerie hurt his chest against Wales while Grandclaude was a second-half replacement against both England and Wales. Valbon, capped in last June\\'s Tests against the United States and Canada, was a second half replacement in the win over Scotland.\\n\\nFrance coach Bernard Laporte said Harinordoquy had been axed after a poor display last weekend. \"Imanol has been dropped from the squad because the least I can say is that he didn\\'t make a thundering comeback against Wales,\" said Laporte. \"We know the Ireland game will be fast and rough and we also want to be able to replace both locks during the game if needed, and Gregory Lamboley can also come on at number seven or eight. \"The Grand Slam is gone but we\\'ll go to Ireland to win. \"It will be a very exciting game because Ireland have three wins under their belt, have just defeated England and have their eyes set on a Grand Slam.\" France, who lost to Wales last week, must defeat the Irish to keep alive their hopes of retaining the Six Nations trophy.

Wasps could still make the knock-out stages as one of the best two runners-up, but need other results in the pool to go their way even if they secure victories over Calvisano and Biarritz next month.\\n\\nWasps skipper Lawrence Dallaglio agreed with Gatland\\'s assessment. \"When you are 19 points down in 15 minutes, you are playing catch-up rugby - and that is very difficult, especially away from home,\" said Dallaglio. \"We can\\'t continue to give ourselves a mountain to climb in these games, even though we finished strongly on both occasions.\" Leicester coach John Wells praised his team\\'s performance in reeling off back-to-back wins over the reigning Premiership and European champions. \"We had to come up with the goods, and it was a massive effort,\" he said. \"It is in our hands now and we know that if we win our next two games we can go through to the quarter-finals. \"But, like last weekend, we could never get away from Wasps. We could never relax and get into any stride. \"Andy Goode has probably done more than anyone during the last two weeks to ensure we finished on the correct side of the score, but it was a massive team effort.\"\\nEngland coach faces rap after row\\n\\nEngland coach Andy Robinson is facing disciplinary action after criticising referee Jonathan Kaplan in his side\\'s Six Nations defeat to Ireland.\\n\\nThe Rugby Football Union (RFU) will investigate Robinson after deciding not to lodge a complaint against Kaplan. Robinson may even have to apologise for his comments in order to avoid sanction from the International Rugby Board. Robinson had said he was \"livid\" about Kaplan\\'s decisions on Saturday to disallow two England \"tries.\" The England coach went on to claim that \"only one side was refereed\".\\n\\nAfter reviewing tapes of the match, the RFU decided not to formally complain to the IRB over the standard of Kaplan\\'s refereeing. Instead the RFU said in a statement they would, \"set out any concerns the England team management may have in a confidential manner\".\\n\\nAn IRB spokesman said on the matter: \"We take all breaches of the code very seriously. \"Should the RFU resolve the issue to our satisfaction, as happened last month when the Scotland coach Matt Williams apologised for remarks made, it would be the end of the matter.\"\\n\\nKaplan has vigorously defended his performance in England\\'s 19-13 defeat at Landsdowne Road and admitted he was \"very disappointed\" with Robinson\\'s remarks. And the South African has been appointed to take charge of Scotland\\'s match against Wales on 13 March.\\n\\nThe RFU recently fined Northampton coach Budge Pountney £2,000 and imposed a six-week ban for his criticism of referee Steve Lander after a Premiership match.\\nAll Black magic: New Zealand rugby\\n\\nPlaying colours:\\n\\nAll black\\n\\nThe Haka and more!\\n\\nThe All Blacks\\n\\nCharles John Munro discovered rugby at London\\'s Christ College, and on his return to Nelson he staged New Zealand\\'s first game. Nelson Town met Nelson College on 14 May, 1870, the Town triumphing by two goals to nil, instigating a game that would become a national obsession and come to dominate the country\\'s sporting passions. The game appealed to the Kiwi psyche and quickly spread, the native Maoris finding a particular empathy with the sport\\'s warrior ethos. In 1888 a British team led by AE Stoddart toured New Zealand and Australia, and soon after a Maori named Joe Warbrick and an English ex-pat called Thomas Eyton decided to gather a combined New Zealand team.\\n\\nTwenty-two Maori and four \\'pakiha\\' formed the \\'New Zealand Native Team,\\' who played a total of 107 matches in New Zealand, Australia and the UK. The integration of white and Maori was a reflecion of enlightened New Zealand rugby and society, even if the British press were somewhat mystified by the pre-match tradition of the Maori war dance, the Haka! The other great symbol of New Zealand rugby, the all black kit with the silver fern on the breast, was proposed by Tom Ellison at the first annual meeting of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union in 1893. New Zealand played their first international against Australia in 1903, the Kiwis triumphing 22-3 in Sydney, and the following year an official British touring team came to New Zealand for the first time. The tourists had gone through Australia undefeated but their captain, David Revell Bedell-Sivright, created animosity in New Zealand with his patronising attitude. The Kiwis shocked the rugby world with a 9-3 triumph in Wellington, sparking great celebrations across the country, but Bedell-Sivright churlishly suggested that the victors would have no chance when they visited the UK.\\n\\nTheir opportunity to prove him wrong came in 1905 with the first official New Zealand tour to Europe. The tourists won their early games with a quick-thinking, inventive approach, but press criticism began to grow over their 2-3-2 scrum formation that left a \\'roving\\' forward free to disrupt opposition attacks. The tactic was effective, two late tries seeing the Kiwis to a 12-7 win over Scotland, before Ireland were despatched 15-0 in Dublin. A huge crowd at Crystal Palace convulsed with laughter at the sight of the Haka - but the smiles were soon wiped from their faces when the tourists ran in five tries in a 15-0 hammering of England. New Zealand headed to Wales to meet a country in the midst of its first \\'Golden Age,\\' and the encounter would be the first in a series of controversial clashes between the sides. An excellent try on the left wing by Teddy Morgan sealed a 3-0 win in a hard-fought encounter at Cardiff Arms Park, but post-match talk was dominated by a Bob Deans try that was ruled out by Scottish referee John Dallas. Dallas said that Deans was tackled short, but the Kiwi said he was dragged back into the field of play after grounding a try - on his death-bed three years later he exclaimed: \"I did score that try in Cardiff.\"\\n\\nFour of the 1905 All Blacks went over to the newly formed \\'All Golds\\' rugby league side soon after the tour, but New Zealand were strong enough to crush an Anglo-Welsh touring team in 1908. The first South Africa tour of New Zealand in 1921 saw honours shared in a three-Test series, starting the greatest rivalry in rugby - and the long-running controversy between the countries over the All Blacks\\' inclusion of Maori players. The awesome 1924-5 All Black tourists became known as \\'The Invincibles\\' after winning all 30 of their games in France, Britain and Ireland, including a crushing 19-0 victory over Wales at St Helen\\'s. Despite their success, the All Blacks\\' 2-3-2 scrum formation left them somewhat short of possession at times, and the flaws were exploited by the Springboks in South Africa in 1928. Employing the modern 3-4-1 scrum line-up against the New Zealand \\'rover\\' system for the first time, South African teams defeated the All Blacks in five games and the Test series was drawn two-all. The controversial New Zealand scrum method finally disappeared after the 1930 Lions tour (a series won 3-1 by New Zealand), the Lions manager describing the tactic as \\'cheating,\\' prompting the International Rugby Board to rule that three men had to pack down in the front row of the scrum.\\n\\nThe All Blacks\\' 1935 European tour started inauspiciously with an 11-3 loss to a Swansea side inspired by teenage, schoolboy half-backs Hayden Tanner and Willie Davies. A thrilling Test at Cardiff Arms Park went to Wales 13-12, although the winning try from Geoffrey Rees-Jones was controversial following an illegal Claude Davey tackle in the build-up. New Zealand\\'s next visit to Wales in 1953 proved difficult as they lost 8-3 to Cardiff and drew 6-6 at Swansea. The All Blacks were on top in the Test with Wales at the Arms Park, but the teams were locked at 8-8 when a Clem Thomas cross kick was gathered by Ken Jones for a famous, match-winning try. The tourists made some amends with wins over the other home nations, before a 19-5 success over the Barbarians in an Arms Park thriller. New Zealand built from that tour, and by the time they returned in 1963-4 they were undoubtedly the leading side in the world.\\n\\nThat made the shock all the greater when a drop goal by student John Uzzell gave Newport an unlikely 3-0 win over the tourists at Rodney Parade. Wilson Whinneray\\'s side rallied to beat Wales 6-0, their first win at the Arms Park in four attempts, and went unbeaten through the rest of the tour, but when they returned home the first question put to them was: \"What happened in Newport?\" The only blemish on the record of the awesome 1967 tourists was a draw with East Wales, as they beat the full Wales team 13-6 in Cardiff to take the lead in the series between the countries for the first time. That lead was increased with two comfortable wins for the home side in New Zealand in 1969, the first time Wales had toured the country as an independent team.\\n\\nA ferocious game at the Arms Park in 1972 was edged 19-16 by the All Blacks, a measure of revenge for the defeat inflicted on New Zealand by the Carwyn James-inspired Lions of 1971.\\n\\nJames guided Llanelli to a famous 9-3 win over the tourists at Stradey Park, though, and in the final game of the tour the Barbarians defeated the All Blacks 23-11 in Cardiff in a game regarded by many as the greatest ever played. New Zealand defeated a Wales XV 12-3 at the Arms Park in a non-cap game in 1974, but it was the 1978 game in Cardiff that would reignite the history of controversy between the two countries.\\n\\nWales were leading 12-10 with one minute left when Andy Haden flew to the floor from a line-out. Television pictures clearly showed that he dived, but English referee Roger Quittenton was fooled and awarded a penalty, duly converted by Brian McKechnie for a 13-12 win. Since that infamous game, the competition has largely left Wales v New Zealand fixtures as the men in red have slipped from the pinnacle of the world game. A crushing 23-3 win for New Zealand in Cardiff in the Welsh Rugby Union\\'s 1980 centenary game was a sign of things to come. The new professionalism in the southern hemisphere game that had left Europe behind was shown as the All Blacks swatted Wales aside 49-6 in Brisbane in the semi-final of the inaugural World Cup. The Kiwis went on to claim the Cup, and would inflict further misery on Wales on their ill-fated 1988 tour of New Zealand.\\n\\nA young, talented Wales side left Britain full of confidence as Triple Crown winners, but one of the greatest ever New Zealand teams demolished them 52-3 and 54-9. After also taking some fearful beatings in the provincial games, Wales captain Jonathan Davies returned home calling for urgent change in the national game, but as his views were ignored he - along with a generation of Wales\\' best players - chose to head north to rugby league.\\n\\nA 34-9 win in Cardiff followed for New Zealand in 1989, and at the 1995 World Cup Wales\\' big talk was made to look embarrassing as the All Blacks eased to victory in Johannesburg. A crushing 42-7 Kiwi triumph in Wembley followed in 1997, and as Wales\\' misery increased they turned to New Zealand for their salvation in the shape of coaches Graham Henry and Steve Hansen. There was a temporary resurgence in the Welsh game, but when an experimental New Zealand side came to Cardiff\\'s new Millennium Stadium in 2002 they left with a 43-17 victory.\\n\\nA bruising 55-3 defeat followed for Wales in Hamilton in 2003 as Hansen built towards the World Cup, but in Australia it was a remarkable performance against the All Blacks that gave his side renewed hope. Wales were given no chance going into the game, but in the course of the match they rediscovered the value of attacking flair to lead 37-33 early in the second half. New Zealand rallied to a 53-37 win, but the style shown by Wales has been used as an inspiration as they look to a better future. They now face an All Blacks team led by Henry and Hansen, coming to Europe with a weakened squad at the end of a long season. An encouraging display against South Africa has inspired a confident Wales camp to believe they can claim their first win over the men in black for over 50 years. They have a chance, but clearly history is not on their side.\\nPreview: Ireland v England (Sun)\\n\\nLansdowne Road, Dublin\\n\\nSunday, 27 February\\n\\n1500 GMT\\n\\nBBC1, Radio 4 LW and this website\\n\\nIreland are going for their first Grand Slam since 1948 after two opening wins, and England represent their sternest test of the Championship so far. England were sloppy and leaderless in the defeats against Wales and France and another loss would be unthinkable. The pressure is on coach Andy Robinson and his side have to deliver.\\n\\nDespite England\\'s dramatic dip in form since the World Cup final - they have lost eight of their last 13 matches - Ireland coach Eddie O\\'Sullivan says his side should not underestimate the visitors. \"Had they kicked their points they would have beaten France and that would have created a different landscape for Sunday,\" he said. \"This is England we are talking about. They have a depth of talent and a very good record against Ireland. \"They will target a victory in Dublin as the turning point in their Six Nations.\" The differences between the sides is also highlighted in the team selections for the Dublin encounter.\\n\\nIreland, despite having Gordon D\\'Arcy still out injured, have been boosted by the return of star skipper Brian O\\'Driscoll who missed the Scotland game with a hamstring injury. \"The knowledge that the England game was coming up really helped during rehabilitation,\" he said. \"The will to play in this game was enormous. It doesn\\'t get much bigger than England at home.\" As well as entering the tournament without players like Jonny Wilkinson, Mike Tindall and Richard Hill, England have now lost two tighthead props in Julian White and Phil Vickery while blind-side flanker Lewis Moody is a major concern. Robinson, who received a lot of flak for the inclusion and then dropping of centre Mathew Tait, has kept faith with kicking fly-half Charlie Hodgson despite his horror show at Twickenham. If England slump in Dublin, it will be their worst run of results in the Championship since 1987.\\n\\nBut Robinson was bullish during the week about the game, saying that his side \"are going there to get in their faces\", and has identified the line-out and tackle area as the key to England\\'s chances. And despite the recent results, skipper Jason Robinson believes there is nothing wrong with the mood in the camp. \"There is no lack of confidence in the team,\" said the Sale full-back. \"We have had a good week\\'s training and we are all looking forward to the challenge. \"I still believe in this team. I know if we get our game right we will win the games.\"\\n\\nG Murphy; G Dempsey, B O\\'Driscoll, S Horgan, D Hickie; R O\\'Gara, P Stringer; R Corrigan, S Byrne, J Hayes; M O\\'Kelly, P O\\'Connell; S Easterby, J O\\'Connor, A Foley.\\n\\nF Sheahan, M Horan, D O\\'Callaghan, E Miller, G Easterby, D Humphreys, K Maggs.\\n\\nJ Robinson (capt); M Cueto, J Noon, O Barkley, J Lewsey; C Hodgson, H Ellis; G Rowntree, S Thompson, M Stevens; D Grewcock, B Kay; J Worsley, L Moody, M Corry.\\n\\nA Titterrell, D Bell, S Borthwick, A Hazell, M Dawson, A Goode, O Smith.\\nO\\'Driscoll out of Scotland game\\n\\nIreland captain Brian O\\'Driscoll has been ruled out of Saturday\\'s RBS Six Nations clash against Scotland.\\n\\nO\\'Driscoll was originally named in the starting line-up but has failed to recover from the hamstring injury he picked up in the win over Italy. His replacement will be named after training on Friday morning. Fellow centre Gordon D\\'Arcy is also struggling with a hamstring injury and he will undergo a fitness test on Friday to see if he can play.\\n\\nKevin Maggs would be an obvious replacement at centre while Shane Horgan could also be moved from wing. Ulster wing Tommy Bowe could also be asked to travel with the squad to Scotland as a precautionary measure. The only other change to the Ireland side sees Wasps flanker Johnny O\\'Connor replacing Denis Leamy. O\\'Connor will be winning his third cap after making his debut in the victory over South Africa last November.\\n\\n: Murphy, Horgan, TBC, D\\'Arcy, Hickie, O\\'Gara, Stringer, Corrigan, Byrne, Hayes, O\\'Kelly, O\\'Connell, S Easterby, O\\'Connor, Foley.\\n\\n: Sheahan, Horan, O\\'Callaghan, Miller, G Easterby, Humphreys, Dempsey.\\nRuddock backs Yapp\\'s credentials\\n\\nWales coach Mike Ruddock says John Yapp has what it takes as an international.\\n\\nThe 21-year-old Blues prop is the only uncapped player in Wales\\' Six Nations squad, gaining a chance in the absence of Ospreys loose-head Duncan Jones. \"John is a young man with a big future. He has been playing with the Blues for two years and has racked up mileage on his playing clock,\" said Ruddock. \"He has international size, is a big, physical lad and a good ball-carrier with a high tackle-count.\" Ruddock\\'s assessment was backed up by Yapp\\'s coach at the Blues, former Wales and Lions prop Dai Young.\\n\\n\"John\\'s been on an upward curve all season and is going from strength to strength,\" Young told BBC Sport Wales. \"His ball carrying gives us good go-forward, he impresses in defence and his work-rate is excellent. \"He\\'s working hard on his scrummaging technique, which he is keen to improve to become a destroyer on the loose-head. \"To be fair to him he\\'s not quite there with the scrummaging yet, but nobody can fault his effort, commitment and attitude. \"John\\'s a very strong man and is eager for the challenge, if he\\'s pitched in he won\\'t let anyone down. \"He\\'s developing quickly, but I hope he isn\\'t pushed too quickly in a way that would hurt his development.\"\\n\\nRuddock hopes that the selection of Yapp and Dragons lock Ian Gough - out of the international reckoning since falling out with former coach Steve Hansen - will send a message to other players in Wales. \"John and Ian have been rewarded for impressing during the Heineken Cup competition,\" said Ruddock. \"Both of them have played well, and we want to send a message out that consistently playing well gets you in the squad. \"We believe this is an exciting squad representing traditional values of Welsh rugby, and based on the performances in the November internationals. \"We have strength and experience up front, and well-recognised talent, pace and skill behind. \"The management team just want to get hold of the players and get out on the training pitch at the moment. \"They are all due in on Sunday, and that\\'s when the hard work starts.\"\\nUmaga ready for Lions\\n\\nAll Blacks captain Tama Umaga has warned the British and Irish Lions will be his most fearsome opponents yet ahead of their summer tour.\\n\\nBut Umaga, in England for Saturday\\'s IRB Rugby Aid match, also backed New Zealand to win the three-Test series against the Lions. He told BBC Sport: \"It\\'s potentially the most fearsome line-up I\\'ve ever come up against. They\\'re awesome. \"But I\\'d back us all the way to beat them when they come over.\" Lions boss Sir Clive Woodward is set to announce his squad for the June-July tour next month.\\n\\nWhen Woodward was appointed last year, it was widely believed he would rely heavily on his former England players. But Umaga said: \"He\\'d be hard pushed to do that now considering the shape of the Six Nations. \"Don\\'t get me wrong, England have got a lot of talented guys and I\\'m sure there are some of them who\\'ll make the Lions Test XV. \"But you can\\'t disguise Wales and Ireland in particular. Some of the tries they\\'ve scored have been great. I\\'ll admit it\\'ll be fairly awesome lining up against the likes of Brian O\\'Driscoll.\"\\n\\nUmaga will meet O\\'Driscoll in Saturday\\'s Rugby Aid match at Twickenham, with the Irish captain leading the Northern Hemisphere side. O\\'Driscoll is among a host of players in the Northern Hemisphere squad, coached by Woodward, that are tipped for Lions call-ups. \"It\\'ll be good for us to get an early idea of some of these guys, although a lot can change between now and June,\" Umaga said. The 31-year-old admitted interest in the Lions tour was immense, calling it \"the biggest thing to hit New Zealand since Lord of the Rings\". He added: \"As players, it\\'s enough for us to be driven by the rarity of playing the Lions. In fact, it\\'s not just us All Blacks - it\\'s the talk of the country.\"\\n\\nUmaga admitted the fear of injury weighed on his mind ahead of Saturday\\'s charity game, which features a host of big names including George Gregan, Andrew Mehrtens and Chris Latham. But he admitted the value of the cause - proceeds of the match will go to aiding victims of the tsunami - easily won him over. \"The second [Southern Hemisphere coach] Rod Macqueen made the approach, I didn\\'t hesitate. It was great when New Zealand Rugby then gave me the all clear. \"Thankfully I didn\\'t know anyone that was involved in the tragedy of the tsunami but you couldn\\'t miss all the horrific reports on the news. \"There are so many people that were affected, are still affected and will be affected for a long time. It\\'s just good to know we can do something minor to help out.\"\\n\\n- The match will be televised on BBC One at 1400 GMT on Saturday.\\nOwen set for skipper role\\n\\nWales number eight Michael Owen says replacing Gareth Thomas as Wales\\' captain will be straightforward because of the leadership quality in the squad.\\n\\n\"You dream about playing for Wales, but it never enters your head that you will one day captain your country,\" he said. \"It\\'s an easy job really because there are so many experienced players in the side, but it will be a massive honour.\" Coach Mike Ruddock says the 24-year-old should take the armband from broken thumb victim Thomas against Scotland. Ruddock praised Owen\\'s contribution as vice-captain and pack leader in this year\\'s wins over England, Italy and France, notably his role in the second-half in Paris following Thomas\\' injury. The 22-cap Dragons man says that Thomas will be badly missed, though. \"Gareth is going to be a massive loss because he is a brilliant player and he has done a fantastic job since he has been captain,\" said Owen. \"He has put his own unique stamp on things. We are going to miss him but the strength of the squad is shown when you have someone like Kevin Morgan to step in.\"\\n\\nOwen admitted the Grand Slam had been mentioned within the squad but that no-one was getting carried away with the three victories over England, Italy and France. \"We can\\'t get ahead of ourselves,\" he said. \"We have a massive game next up and we are just looking forward to preparing for that. \"Scotland are improving all the time. Like us they did well in France and were unlucky not to get a win. \"Against Ireland they played fantastically well in the first 15 minutes before falling away. \"They are probably going on a similar journey to the one we have been on in the last couple of years.\"\\nCorry backs skipper Robinson\\n\\nEngland forward Martin Corry says Jason Robinson is the right man to lead the national team back to winning ways.\\n\\nAfter losses to Wales and France, critics have started to wonder whether Robinson can captain from full-back. But Corry has backed Robinson, who was given the role after the injury to fly-half Jonny Wilkinson, ahead of this weekend\\'s trip to Ireland. \"Jason is doing a tremendous job. Every week my respect for him goes up,\" Corry told BBC Radio Five Live. \"He is an inspirational captain. When he talks with the squad he talks with a lot of sense. \"The players have a lot of respect for him. It\\'s an honour to be in the England side and an honour to play under him.\"\\n\\nEngland are under immense pressure following their poor start to the year and victory is vital if they are to rescue their Six Nations campaign. But Corry insists England are in the right frame of mind for the contest. \"There is apprehension going into every game,\" he added. \"But you have to use that fear and put it into a positive mindset. \"When the whistle goes on Sunday, what has happened in the past does not count for anything.\\n\\n\"We have not performed but if we put in a performance on Sunday then we can start turning results around. \"There are a lot of changes taking place with England and we are at the start of something. We have not got off to the greatest of starts but you need to experience the bad the before you can fully appreciate the good.\"\\n\\nA trip to Lansdowne Road is daunting at any time, especially against an Ireland side that are flying high after two impressive wins. They are the form team of the tournament and are tipped to claim their first Grand Slam since 1948. But Corry is relishing the prospect of taking on the Irish in their own backyard. \"They are full of confidence and are playing a great team game,\" he said. \"The forwards are creating a great platform and they have explosive runners out wide. \"If you look at the team on paper, they have stars from one to 15. It\\'s a huge task but it is a great opportunity for us. \"Lansdowne Road is a tremendous venue to play in and we have to use it to our advantage.\"\\nWasps 31-37 Leicester\\n\\nLeicester withstood a stunning Wasps comeback to win a pulsating Heineken Cup encounter at the Causeway Stadium.\\n\\nThe Tigers stormed 22-6 ahead within 18 minutes through tries from Lewis Moody, Geordan Murphy and Martin Corry. European champions Wasps fought back through a Josh Lewsey try and Mark van Gisbergen\\'s boot, and they were level at 31-31 with five minutes remaining. But it was the visitors who kept their cool as Andy Goode kicked the Tigers to victory with a penalty and a drop goal. The closing moments saw desperate defence from Leicester as Wasps turned down several penalties to go for the try they needed. Wasps pounded the line and a penalty try looked likely before referee Nigel Williams controversially blew for full-time. Fly-half Goode was the Tigers hero, kicking 22 points in total, while Leicester\\'s overwhelming domination in the scrums ultimately told. Even their lack of discipline in defence - which presented the admirable Van Ginsberg with 26 points - could not undo them as they held out for a famous win.\\n\\nLawrence Dallaglio\\'s team have now got it all to do in the quest for a quarter-final place given that two of their last three games are away - against Leicester and Biarritz. However, Wasps rugby director Warren Gatland warned his side will will not relinquish their European title without a fight. \"If we lose next week, then we are struggling,\" said Gatland. \"But we don\\'t want to give this trophy away. We worked so hard to win it last season, we will go down fighting. \"We have got to get our scrum right next week, it is the biggest cause for concern.\" Leicester coach John Wells saluted the outstanding work of Graham Rowntree and Julian White, who were magnificent up front. \"They were the backbone of our performance today,\" said Wells. \"And to score three tries against the European champions at home was also something I am pleased about.\"\\n\\nVan Gisbergen; Lewsey, Erinle, Abbott, Voyce; King, Dawson; Dowd, Greening, Green; Shaw, Birkett; Worsley, O\\'Connor, Dallaglio (capt).\\n\\nReplacements: Gotting, McKenzie, Lock, Hart, Biljon, Brooks, Hoadley.\\n\\nMurphy; Rabeni, Smith, Gibson, Healey; Goode, Ellis; Rowntree, Chuter, White, M Johnson (capt), L Deacon; Moody, Back, Corry.\\n\\nReplacements (from): Buckland/Cockerill, Morris, Kay, W Johnson/B Deacon, H Tuilagi, Bemand, A Tuiliagi, Lloyd, Vesty.\\nRef stands by Scotland decisions\\n\\nThe referee from Saturday\\'s France v Scotland Six Nations match has defended the officials\\' handling of the game after criticism by Matt Williams.\\n\\nThe Scotland coach said his side were robbed of victory by poor decisions made by the officials. But Nigel Williams said: \"I\\'m satisfied the game was handled correctly.\" Meanwhile, Matt Williams will not be punished by the Scottish Rugby Union for allegedly using bad language in his comments about the officials. He denies having done so. Nonetheless, he was furious about several decisions that he felt denied his side a famous victory. But Nigel Williams told the Scottish Daily Mail: \"I spoke to Matt Williams at the post-match dinner. \"He made no mention of the disallowed try or any other refereeing decisions whatsoever. \"If Matt has issues with the match officials, then he is very welcome to phone me and discuss them. \"Ultimately there is a match assessor at every international game to give an impartial and objective view of the performance of the officials. \"That is the beginning and end of it.\"\\nProp Jones ready for hard graft\\n\\nAdam Jones says the Wales forwards are determined to set the perfect attacking platform for the backs by dominating the powerful France pack in Paris.\\n\\nThe prop said: \"If we get stuffed in the front five our backs have had it. \"The mentality of the French is \\'scrum, scrum, scrum\\'. We will see how good France are and the scrum is the key. \"I just hope [the backs] carry on where they left off against Italy. It\\'s just up to us in the forwards to win the ball and give them the opportunity.\" Wales have won two of their last three visits to Stade de France, having secured back-to-back wins under Graham Henry in 1999 and 2001. And with the likes of Shane Williams and Gavin Henson finding top form at the right time, Mike Ruddock\\'s team is now one of international rugby\\'s most potent attacking threats. \"Gavin is ridiculously talented. He has been bouncing around the place this week, so he is up for it,\" warned Jones.\\n\\nFrance have been criticised for their uncharacteristic one-dimensional play in their victories over Scotland and France. Captain Fabien Pelous has acknowledged his side needs to show more attacking flair, but stressed the game with be won or lost up front. The lock believes the Welsh forwards are not big enough to trouble his side in the scrum or line-out, but Jones insisted his fellow front-row colleagues have nothing to fear.\\n\\n\"Gethin [Jenkins] won\\'t be intimidated tomorrow, none of us will,\" said Jones, who will be facing France for the first time. \"We will go out there and front up and hopefully get the ball out to the backs. \"Me and Gethin are quite young so it is good to have someone of Mefin\\'s experience in there. \"Mefin is a good thinker who puts things across. But what is the saying? If you are good enough you are old enough and Gethin certainly is. \"He is a really good player and I imagine he will be on the Lions tour [to New Zealand this summer].\"\\nEngland \\'to launch ref protest\\'\\n\\nEngland will protest to the International Rugby Board (IRB) about the referee\\'s performance in the defeat by Ireland, reports the Daily Mail.\\n\\nEngland coach Andy Robinson has called on ex-international referees Colin High and Steve Lander to analyse several of Jonathan Kaplan\\'s decisions. \"I want to go through the tape with Colin and Steve,\" Robinson told the Daily Mail. \"I want to speak to the IRB about it. I think only one side was refereed.\" High, the Rugby Football Union\\'s referees\\' manager, claimed Kaplan made three major errors which changed the outcome of Sunday\\'s match. England were beaten 19-13 by the Irish in Dublin, their third straight defeat in the 2005 Six Nations. \"The International Rugby Board will be disappointed,\" High told the Daily Mail. \"Jonathan Kaplan is in the top 20 in the world but that wasn\\'t an international performance. \"It would not have been acceptable in the Zurich Premiership. \"If one of my referees had done that, I would have had my backside kicked for making the appointment. \"If any English referee refereed like that in a European match, there would be an inquest. No question about that. \"If someone had performed like that, he would have been pulled from the next game.\"\\nDallaglio eyeing Lions tour place\\n\\nFormer England captain Lawrence Dallaglio still harbours hopes of a place on the British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand.\\n\\nLions coach Sir Clive Woodward has made it clear he will pick his squad to tour next summer based on form shown in the Six Nations championship. But Dallaglio, who called time on England earlier this year, said: \"I assure you I wouldn\\'t let anyone down. \"I know what it takes and what I have to offer,\" he told the Daily Telegraph. Dallaglio toured South Africa with the Lions in 1997 but was forced home early with a knee injury from the trip to Australia three years ago.\\n\\nThe 32-year-old also felt concentrating on club rugby could have prolonged his international shelf-life. He said: \"I\\'ll be in good shape and fresh without another 10 Tests on the clock. \"From what I witnessed at close quarters on Sunday in our Heineken Cup match against Leicester, I certainly didn\\'t feel out of place alongside those players, many of whom will be on the trip.\\n\\n\"If I\\'m fit and playing well, then I\\'m most certainly available. \"If Clive feels he has no need to look outside the international crop, then fine. If he does, then he won\\'t need to look too far, will he?\"\\nWorcester v Sale (Fri)\\n\\nSixways\\n\\nFriday, 25 February\\n\\n2000 GMT\\n\\nThey make just one change, with Tim Collier replacing Phil Murphy in the second row. In contrast, Sale are missing 14 players due to a combination of international call-ups and injuries. John Payne and Chris Rhys Jones come into the centres while scrum-half Richard Wigglesworth looks set to play on the wing.\\n\\nDelport; Pieters, Rasmussen, Lombard, O\\'Leary; Brown, Powell; Windo, Van Niekerk, Horsman; Collier, Gillies; Hickey, Sanderson, MacLeod- Henderson.\\n\\nReplacements: Fortey, Murphy, Daly, Vaili, Cole, Hayes, Trueman.\\n\\nHanley; Mayor, Payne, Rhys Jones, Wigglesworth; Hercus, Redpath (capt); Turner, Roddam, Stewart; Day, Schofield; Caillet, Carter, Chabal.\\n\\nReplacements (from): Bozzi, Coutts, Anglesea, Lund, Martens, Riley, Duffy, C Jones.\\nPlayer burn-out worries Robinson\\n\\nEngland coach Andy Robinson says English rugby has to act now to prevent injury destroying players\\' careers.\\n\\nHe will be without a host of big names for the Six Nations as the intensity of professional rugby union hits players. \"Injuries are part of the sport but we have to have a look at the amount of injuries that occur in the English season,\" Robinson told BBC Sport. \"I think players are probably going to have three or four years taken off their careers.\" Robinson will be missing an entire midfield for the Six Nations with the likes of Jonny Wilkinson, Mike Tindall and Will Greenwood injured.\\n\\nRugby union has become far more physically demanding since the game went professional nearly 10 years ago. As a result three of the major stakeholders in English rugby have launched an \"injury audit\" to find out how players are coping. The audit is jointly funded by the Professional Rugby Players\\' Association, the Rugby Football Union and Premier Rugby. As far as Robinson is concerned its findings must not be ignored. \"I think there\\'s an injury audit coming out in March that\\'s got some great information in there that I think everybody in the English game has got to look at,\" he said. \"If we don\\'t the situation is going to get worse and not better, so I think rugby as a whole has got to look at this.\"\\nWRU proposes season overhaul\\n\\nThe Welsh Rugby Union wants to restructure the Northern Hemisphere season into four separate blocks.\\n\\nThe season would start with the Celtic League in October, followed by the Heineken Cup in February and March, and the Six Nations moved to April and May. After a nine week break, the WRU then proposes a two-month period of away and home international matches. WRU chairman David Pickering said the structure would end problems of player availability for club and country. He added: \"We feel sure that spectator interest would respond to the impetus of high intensity rugby being played continuously rather than the fragmented timetable currently in operation. \"Equally, we suspect that the sponsors would prefer the sustained interest in a continuous tournament and hopefully, the broadcasters would also enjoy increased exposure.\" Moving the Six Nations from its traditional February beginning should also ensure better weather conditions and \"stimulate greater interest in the games and generally provide increased skills and competition and attract greater spectator viewing\", Pickering argued. The plan will be put before the International Rugby Board next month, where four other plans drawn up by independent consultants for a global integrated season will also be discussed. Pickering added: \"It\\'s very early days and there are a number of caveats associated with it - not least the revenue from the broadcasters, which is extremely important. \"We\\'ve got a good plan and one which should be judged on its merits.\"\\nMoore questions captaincy\\n\\nBrian Moore believes the England captain should not be a full-back.\\n\\nJason Robinson has led the team during their opening three defeats in the Six Nations tournament, in the absence of fly-half Jonny Wilkinson. The world champions have struggled since the retirement of former captain Martin Johnson, a lock forward. And former England captain Moore told the BBC: \"Full-backs are too far away from the action. That\\'s not a reflection on Robinson personally.\" He added: \"I just think the point of influence needs to move closer to the pack - which is, after all, where games usually start and finish.\" Moore says a lack of cohesion in the forwards is one of the reasons why England have lost against Wales, France and Ireland in this year\\'s tournament. \"Assertiveness in the pack isn\\'t there, we\\'re not getting enough people into the breakdowns,\" he explained. \"Wer\\'e not getting quick ball, which means the backs are being stifled. Their creativity depends on quick ball and we\\'re not getting that.\"\\n\\nWith injuries depriving him of key players like Wilkinson, coach Andy Robinson has given youngsters such as Harry Ellis and Jamie Noon a chance. And Moore believes the last two games against Italy and Scotland are a good opportunity to experiment further. \"The problem is the players that are around to replace the icons which have been lost because of retirement and injury don\\'t have the requisite experience,\" Moore added. \"You can\\'t do anything about that but play them. There are players who have been knocking on the door, it\\'s time for them to be looked at in these last two games because there\\'s nothing on them. \"We then go into next season with a greater certainty of who can and cannot handle the pressure of international rugby.\"\\nMarshall set for Leeds move\\n\\nAll Blacks scrum-half Justin Marshall has agreed a two-year contract to play for Leeds from next season.\\n\\nThe 31-year-old has a release clause in his New Zealand contract which allows him to move after the 2005 Lions tour. \"It is a really exciting challenge and something new for me,\" Marshall told BBC Sport. Leeds rugby director Phil Davies added: \"Justin is a world class player who will add greatly to this group with his professionalism on and off the field.\" Marshall is the most capped New Zealand back of all time with 77 Tests behind him, but was left at home for the All Blacks\\' European tour in November. He did travel to England to captain the Barbarians against his international team-mates at Twickenham, and is intent on reclaiming his Test spot ahead of the Lions\\' visit in June. \"I am committed to New Zealand rugby this season,\" he added. \"I enjoy a good challenge and it would be great to face the Lions.\" Marshall is preparing to start training with the Canterbury Crusaders, whom he has helped to four Super 12 titles, on Monday ahead of the new season. His intended departure later this year comes with the blessing of All Blacks coach Graham Henry. \"I fully understand why Justin is making the change at this stage of his career,\" Henry said. \"While we never like losing world-class players from our ranks, there is no doubting that he has served New Zealand rugby well over a long period of time.\"\\nHurter flees Falcons nest for SA\\n\\nNewcastle tight-head prop Marius Hurter will end six years in the north-east when he returns to his native South Africa before the new year.\\n\\nHurter, 34, has signed a deal to play Super 12 rugby with the Cats and then the Currie Cup with the Lions. He also wants to further his law studies, while his wife is expecting their first child in seven months. Falcons boss Rob Andrew, said: \"Losing Marius is a blow to us but we recognise he has a new life to go to.\" Hurter, capped 13 times by the Springboks, was a member of their World Cup-winning squad in 1995.\\n\\nHe signed for the Falcons in 1998 and has played over 100 Zurich Premiership matches, helping the club lift the Powergen Cup in 2001 and 2004. Hurter will remain in contention for the Falcons\\' next two matches against Saracens and Leeds, before flying to South Africa on 30 December. \"We obviously wish Marius and his family all the best for their future, and I just hope that South Africa is ready for a guy who we would certainly class as a fully fledged Geordie,\" Andrew added. \"His shoes will be big ones to fill, but we are looking at replacements as we try and build on all the good work that Marius has done for us, not only with his own play but with his help for all of the younger props at the club.\" Hurter said: \"I\\'ve had an amazing time here. It\\'s been a great six years, but the plan was always to go back. \"Newcastle is a fantastic city with wonderful people, but my heart still lies in South Africa.\"\\nFit-again Betsen in France squad\\n\\nFrance have brought flanker Serge Betsen back into their squad to face England at Twickenham on Sunday.\\n\\nBut the player, who missed the victory over Scotland through injury, must attend a disciplinary hearing on Wednesday after being cited by Wasps. \"Serge has a good case so we are confident he will play,\" said France coach Bernard Laporte. The inexperienced Nicolas Mas, Jimmy Marlu and Jean-Philippe Grandclaude are also included in a 22-man squad. The trio have been called up after Pieter de Villiers, Ludovic Valbon and Aurelien Rougerie all picked up injuries in France\\'s 16-9 win on Saturday.\\n\\nLaporte said he was confident that Betsen would be cleared by the panel investigating his alleged trip that broke Wasps centre Stuart Abbott\\'s leg. \"If he was to be suspended, we would call up Imanol Harinordoquy or Thomas Lievremont,\" said Laporte, who has dropped Patrick Tabacco. \"We missed Serge badly against Scotland. He has now recovered from his thigh injury and played on Saturday with Biarritz.\" France\\'s regular back-row combination of Betsen, Harinordoquy and Olivier Magne were all missing from France\\'s side at the weekend because of injury. Laporte is expected to announce France\\'s starting line-up on Wednesday.\\n\\nForwards: Nicolas Mas, Sylvain Marconnet, Olivier Milloud, William Servat, Sebastien Bruno, Fabien Pelous, Jerome Thion, Gregory Lamboley, Serge Betsen, Julien Bonnaire, Sebastien Chabal, Yannick Nyanga. Backs: Dimitri Yachvili, Pierre Mignoni, Frederic Michalak, Yann Delaigue, Damien Traille, Brian Liebenberg, Jean-Philippe Grandclaude, Christophe Dominici, Jimmy Marlu, Pepito Elhorga.\\nPakistan arrive for tour of India\\n\\nPakistan arrived in Delhi on Monday amid tight security for their first full tour of India for six years.\\n\\nThe 16-man squad, along with coach Bob Woolmer and support staff, were met at the heavily guarded Indira Gandhi airport after a 45-minute flight. Armed guards kept vigil as the tourists were taken to their hotel along a six-mile route lined with security men. Hindu fundamentalists have threatened to protest over perceived Pakistani backing to militancy in Kashmir. \"I am delighted to be back in India,\" captain Inzamam-ul-Haq said. \"I have always enjoyed playing here because people are crazy about cricket. \"I am not worried about security. My only concern is how my team plays on the tour.\" Series between India and Pakistan are always eagerly awaited, largely because politics often restrict the amount of cricket the two teams can play against each other.\\n\\nThis particular engagement, which will include three Tests and six one-dayers, was twice threatened. The schedule has already been put back four days over a dispute which centred on Pakistan\\'s refusal to play the second Test in Ahmedabad. The first Test in Mohali will now get under way on 8 March. Then, following a protracted row over television rights, the Madras High Court issued interim orders to ensure the matches would be broadcast live by state=owned channel Doordarshan. Inzamam beseeched his side to make up for the 2004 defeat to India on home soil, where they lost 2-1 in the Tests and 3-2 in the one-day internationals. He said: \"We want to make amends for last year. \"The Australian tour was a big learning experience and I think we are in a position to reap benefits in India.\" After the 2004 series, Pakistan sacked their coach Javed Miandad and replaced him with Woolmer. Inzamam believes Woolmer has improved the side even if a string of positive results have not yet come.\\n\\nHe said: \"A lot has changed since that series. Woolmer has helped change the attitude of the boys, which is more positive and professional and I think they can take the pressure of playing in India.\" Pakistan will be without strike bowler Shoaib Akhtar (hamstring), leaving recalled off-spinner Arshad Khan and leg-spinner Danish Kaneria with much work to do. Inzamam said: \"Shoaib\\'s absence will be felt. But our strength is playing as a unit. \"[Khan and Kaneria] have a big role to play. They are the ones on whom we will be depending a lot in the Test matches. \"We are expecting slow, turning tracks and we have been practicing for such conditions.\" Pakistan\\'s first match is a three-day warm-up against the Indian Board President\\'s XI in Dharamsala from March 3.\\n\\nSourav Ganguly (captain), Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, VVS Laxman, Yuvraj Singh, Dinesh Karthik (wicketkeeper), Irfan Pathan, Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra, Lakshmipathy Balaji.\\n\\nSalman Butt, Yasir Hameed, Taufeeq Umar, Younis Khan, Inzamam-ul-Haq (captain), Yousuf Youhana, Asim Kamal, Kamran Akmal (wkt), Abdul Razzaq, Shoaib Malik, Shahid Afridi, Arshad Khan, Danish Kaneria, Muhammad Sami, Rana Naved, Muhammad Khalil.\\nBracewell worried by Lee\\n\\nNew Zealand coach John Bracewell is furious that Australia paceman Brett Lee has bowled four beamers at his batsmen in the current one-day series.\\n\\nBrendon McCullum was struck on the arm by a waist-high full toss in Auckland on Sunday, a match Australia won. Bracewell said: \"He\\'s been apologetic every time he\\'s done it. \"He was apologetic when he did it to Chris Harris, and Paul Wiseman, and he\\'s apologised twice to Brendon. That\\'s a lot of apologies.\"\\n\\nBracewell was also of the view that Lee had bowled a beamer at Pakistan\\'s Abdul Razzaq during the VB Series. On Sunday, a furious McCullum confronted Lee mid-pitch after being struck on the arm, and while the incident was later resolved, Bracewell was not happy. Lee, who took 2-24 off seven overs on Saturday and also sent Michael Papps to hospital with a bouncer, was contrite afterwards.\\n\\nHe said the heavy dew caused his feet to shift on delivery stride and he lost control against McCullum. \"Unfortunately the ball came out and it hit him - thank God it didn\\'t hurt him,\" said Lee. \"I know when I was beamed accidently by Razzaq [also in the VB Series] your first impression is to go crazy. \"[McCullum] lost it there for 15-20 seconds and I went up and apologised and said \\'I would never mean to do that\\'.\" Australia captain Ricky Ponting refuses to admit there is animosity between the sides despite Bracewell\\'s disquiet. \"Teams have got on very well,\" Ponting said. \" \"We\\'ve been in each other\\'s rooms after every game. Relations have been very good. \"The only thing was the full-toss that Brett bowled, otherwise everything\\'s been great. It\\'s been a good series played in great spirit.\" In the laws of the game, a bowler is removed from the attack by the umpires for bowling two beamers in a match, whether accidental or not. Any delivery that passes the batsman at or above waist-height without bouncing is deemed a no-ball.\\nA year to remember for Irish\\n\\nThere used to be one subliminal moment during a year in Irish rugby that stood out more than most.\\n\\nWell, at least there used to one. Now there is a handful to look back with a mixture of satisfaction, and sorrow. It has been quite a year for the Irish, and not just with Eddie O\\'Sullivan\\'s Triple Crown winning international outfit either. Right down through the ranks Irish rugby is creating waves and upsetting the more established teams in the game. But most of the kudos will go to O\\'Sullivan and his merry band of warriors who not only collected their first Triple Crown for 29 years, but also finished their autumn campaign with a 100% record. For the second year in succession they also finished in the runners-up spot in the RBS Six Nations. But in the three games in November which included a victory over Tri-Nations champions and Grand Slam chasing South Africa, Ireland finsihed the year on a high. The 18-12 victory at Lansdowne Road was only their second victory over the Boks after the initial success back in 1965. That success was revenge for the consecutive defeats in Blomefontein and Cape Town in the summer. Those two reverses and the 35-17 flop against France, were the only dark patches in an otherwise excellent 12 months. But the big one, of course, was the 19-13 defeat of World Cup champions England on their precious Twickenham turf. The winning try was conceived in O\\'Sullivan\\'s mind, perfectly executed by the team and finished immaculately by Girvan Dempsey. For me, the try of the Championship. O\\'Sullivan\\'s career is now in vertical take-off mode. It is no wonder that Sir Clive Woodward has elevated the Galway-based coach to head the Lions Test side. Not only that, but a fair majority of the present Ireland side will be wearing red next June in New Zealand.\\n\\nThere can be no doubt that Ireland\\'s representation will be the biggest ever, albeit in a proposed 44-man squad. In Brian O\\'Driscoll and Paul O\\'Connell, Ireland have now the two front-runners for the captaincy. Gordon D\\'Arcy, whose career began as a teenager back in 1999, finally arrived when he was named the Six Nations Player of the Tournament. But it was not only the senior squad that brought kudos to Ireland, the youngsters strutted their stuff on the big stage as well. The under-21 squad confounded the doubters as they went all the way to the World Cup final in Scotland only to be beaten by a powerful All Black side in the decider. The young Irish boys had stated their intentions earlier in the season when they finished runners-up to England in the Six Nations under-21 tournament. On the provincial front, Leinster, for second year in succession, blew it when the Heineken Cup looked a good wager. While Ulster finished runners-up in their very tight group for the second season in succession, it was Munster again flying the flag for the Irish. Looking to reach their third final, they went down 37-32 to eventual winners Wasps in what many beileve was the most competitive and thunderous game ever witnessed at Lansdowne Road. How Wasps recovered from that energy-sapping duel, and then go onto to defeat Toulouse in the final was anybody\\'s guess. Ulster, meanwhile, just lost out to adding the inaugural Celtic Cup in winning the Celtic League when they were pipped at the post by the Scarlets in the final game.\\n\\nUlster, however, took time to start the new season under new coach Mark McCall. The once famous Ravenhill fortress was breached four times as Ulster only manged five wins from their first 12 outings in the Celtic League. Leinster are again looking the most potent outfit going into 2005, but whether they can take that final step under Declan Kidney is another thing. On the down side, Irish rugby was hit by a number of tragedies. Teenage star John McCall died while playing for the Ireland against New Zealand in the under-19 World Cup game in Durban. That happened only 10 days after he led Royal Armagh to their first Ulster Schools\\' Cup success since 1977. The death of former Ireland coach and Lions flanker Mike Doyle in a car crash in Northern Ireland shocked the rugby fraternity A larger than life character, Doyle had coached Ireland to the Triple Crown in 1985, the last time that goal had been achieved before this season. Ulster rugby also suffered the sudden deaths of well-known Londonderry YM player Jim Huey, Coleraine\\'s Jonathan Hutchinson, and Belfast Harlequins lock Johnny Poole. They all passed away long before the full-time whistle.\\nIndia\\'s top six secure - Ganguly\\n\\nCaptain Sourav Ganguly has revealed India will not be tempted into tinkering with their batting order for the first Test against Pakistan.\\n\\n\"Our batting order for the Tests is fixed. There are no changes from number three to six,\" Ganguly told BBC Sport. It means Rahul Dravid will remain at number three and VVS Laxman at six, despite the latter averaging 53.5 at first drop in Test cricket. \"To be honest, Dravid has batted better than Laxman at three,\" Ganguly added. \"If you ask any batsman, he would like to bat higher up, as it gives a greater opportunity to score. \"While batting lower down the order, you have to play more with the tail.\" Ganguly gave his backing to Gautam Gambhir, banishing speculation Yuvraj Singh could be asked to open the batting again after a failed experiment against Australia last year.\\n\\n\"I feel there is no born opener - the team has to find one,\" he stated. \"Look at Justin Langer, he was not an opener, but how well the Aussies have groomed him. Virender Sehwag is a settled opener now both in Tests and one-dayers, and Gambhir is doing well. \"In a year\\'s time, we should have a settled opening pair.\" Sachin Tendulkar, who will bat at number four with Ganguly at five, also received the support of his skipper despite concerns over fitness and form. \"When Sachin says he is 100 percent fit, he is, and nobody has a right to talk about the form of a man who has 70 international hundreds.\" With wicket-keeper Dinesh Karthik to come in at number seven, India are left with just four spots for bowlers - suggesting Yuvraj could miss out.\\n\\nMohali, which will host the first Test starting on 8 March, is known as a seam-friendly pitch and India have included four pacemen in their 14-man squad. In addition to spinners Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh, India will be forced to choose from the pace quartet of Irfan Pathan, Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra and Lakshmipathy Balaji. \"In Kumble and Harbhajan, we have two world class spinners and at the moment there is no place for a third one,\" Ganguly said. \"Our seam attack had done particularly well during the Pakistan tour last year, and we will select the final eleven after having a look at the wickets in Mohali, which has had a record of a seaming track.\" Ganguly refused to get carried away with the fact Pakistan\\'s pace attack has been depleted with the absence of Shoaib Akhtar through injury.\\n\\n\"I feel Pakistan has a young and fit team, which is hungry for success. In my view they have done the right thing by bringing a fit team, rather than bringing injured players,\" he said. \"It is better to have a fully fit team than having an injured Shoaib Akhtar or even Don Bradman for that matter. \"I do not agree with those who say Pakistan\\'s team is weak and has given India a walkover. \"It will be a tough series and the next 50 days will be a treat for fans of both sides.\"\\nWest Indies opener Rae mourned\\n\\nFormer West Indies Test batsman Allan Rae has died in Kingston, Jamaica, at the age of 82 after a long illness.\\n\\nRae scored 1,016 runs in 15 Tests as an opener between 1948-1953, averaging 46.18 and making four centuries. He was part of the first Windies team to defeat England in a Test series in 1950, before quitting the first-class game to focus on his legal career. Rae then went on to become president of the West Indies Cricket Board, a position he held from 1981-1988. In his book, A History of West Indies Cricket, former Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley said Rae \"brought to the presidency some of the most important characteristics of the finest administrative leaders, a deep sense of tradition with a mind always open to change\". He praised Rae\\'s behind the scenes work with Sir Don Bradman to bring the West Indies and Australia players involved in Kerry Packer\\'s World Series back into the cricket establishment. During his time as president, a number of West Indies players were given life bans for going on unauthorised tours to South Africa. Rae\\'s playing career began in 1946-47 and he soon earned a place in the West Indies team, marking his first series with centuries against India in Bombay (now Mumbai) and Madras (Chennai). Part of a strong opening partnership with Jeff Stollmeyer, he is best remembered for his part in the 1950 tour to England when he made 106 at Lord\\'s and 109 at The Oval as West Indies won the series 3-1. He only played six Tests thereafter, his last against India at Port of Spain in February 1953. \"Allan meant so much to our cricket, not only as a player, but also as a hard-working administrator,\" said Bryan Breese, chief executive of the Jamaica Cricket Association. \"He even neglected his legal practice at times because of his dedication to cricket in Jamaica.\"\\nDawson set for new Wasps contract\\n\\nEuropean champions Wasps are set to offer Matt Dawson a new deal.\\n\\nThe 31-year-old World Cup winning scrum-half has impressed since joining the London side from Northampton this summer on a one-year contract. Wasps coach Warren Gatland told the Daily Mirror: \"We have not yet offered Matt a new contract but we will be doing so. \"I\\'m very happy with his contribution and I think he\\'s good enough to play for another couple of years.\" Dawson played a vital part in England\\'s World Cup win last year but has fallen out of favour with new coach Andy Robinson after missing a training session in September. However he hopes the new deal will help him regain his England place.\\n\\n\"Rugby is still my priority and there\\'s still a burning desire within me to play the best rugby I possibly can,\" he said. \"I know within myself, if I was given the chance I could play for England again. \"I know I\\'m fit enough, I\\'m strong enough, I\\'m skilful enough.\"\\nHodges announces rugby retirement\\n\\nScarlets and USA Eagles forward Dave Hodges has ended his playing career to pursue a coaching role in the States.\\n\\nThe 36-year-old, who has 54 caps, was Llanelli\\'s player of the season in 2001/2, but has battled injury for the last two of his seven years at Stradey. He tore a pectoral muscle against the Ospreys on Boxing Day, an injury that would have kept him out for the season. \"Realising I would be unable to play this season, the club and I agreed to end my contract early,\" said Hodges.\\n\\n\"It allows me to move back to the US and pursue opportunities there and allows the Scarlets to look to the next generation.\" The Scarlets have begun to rebuild their squad for next season after a disappointing Heineken Cup campaign, with plenty more signings and departures expected in the coming weeks.\\n\\nScarlets chief executive Stuart Gallacher confirmed that 17 of the current squad would be out of contract in the summer. \"We have a deliberate policy whereby around half the squad are coming out of contract and they know they won\\'t all be re-signed, it\\'s a chance to invigorate the squad,\" he said. \"I\\'m positive about the future of the Scarlets both on and off the field.\" Gallacher was keen to pay tribute to the role back-five forward Hodges has played at Stradey Park, though. \"David has been a highly influential member of our squad for seven years,\" said Gallacher. \"He is a real professional and we thank him for the part he has played in our success. \"I am sure he has an enormous contribution to make to the development of rugby in the US and we wish him and his family well.\" Hodges described his years at Stradey as \"the best time of my life.\"\\nItaly aim to rattle England\\n\\nItaly coach John Kirwan believes his side can upset England as the Six Nations wooden spoon battle hots up.\\n\\nThe two sides, both without a win, meet on 12 March at Twickenham and Kirwan says his side will be hoping to make the most of England\\'s current slump. \"We have to make sure the England and France games are tough for them. \"England have not been having the best of championships. That is a big one for us and them and I am sure my players will rise to the occasion,\" he said. But Kirwan admits that a lot of hard work will be needed with his kickers before the trip to London. Roland de Marigny and Luciano Orquera had a miserable time with the boot in the dire defeat to Scotland as Chris Paterson stole the show to give the hosts a much-needed 18-10 victory. Kirwan said: \"The kicking was the decisive factor in Scotland which cost us and it could go down to the kicking again next time. \"But I have a lot of confidence in my players and I am positive we can put everything together against England.\" England, meanwhile, are licking their wounds and rueing what might have been had two decisions from referee Jonathan Kaplan not gone against them in the second half in Dublin. First Mark Cueto was judged offside as he chased fly-half Charlie Hodgson\\'s kick, and then Kaplan opted not to call upon video evidence to see if Josh Lewsey had touched down after being driven over Ireland\\'s line.\\n\\nBut centre Jamie Noon believes the side at least showed better form than their previous two defeats. \"We definitely improved against an in-form Irish side,\" he said. \"We went to Dublin quietly confident that we would be able to compete, and I think we showed that. \"We have got to make sure we now take the form and positives into the Italy game. We are under no illusions that it is going to be easy, but we definitely need a win.\" England have now equalled an 18-year low of four successive championship defeats, including France in Paris last season, and have lost four in a row under Andy Robinson. His predecessor, Sir Clive Woodward, began his seven-year reign with three defeats and two draws.\\nIreland win eclipses refereeing \\'errors\\'\\n\\nThe International Rugby Board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go belly-up.\\n\\nIt may have to go the whole way and have NFL-style video cameras all over the field, or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles. What the IRB does not want is a football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself. Sunday\\'s explosive Six Nations clash at Lansdowne Road was a good example as Ireland took another step towards their first Grand Slam since 1948. The game was as exciting as it comes, with a much-improved England side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way. One can understand that frustration. There was no doubt that Ireland had the rub of the green in their 19-13 victory, but the reaction from the England camp may not have endeared them to the sport\\'s \"blazers\". Referee Jonathan Kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece. I doubt whether Kaplan would have been too pleased at the comments made. After all, he has no public recourse to criticism.\\n\\nIt was the same for Simon McDowell, the touch judge who was heavily criticised by Scotland coach Matt Williams after their defeat against France. As far as England were concerned, there were queries over Mark Cueto\\'s first half-effort when he went over in the corner from a Charlie Hodgson kick.\\n\\nEngland coach Andy Robinson referred to a similar case at Ravenhill in January when Ulster were playing Gloucester in the Heineken Cup. On that occasion, David Humphreys kicked to Tommy Bowe, who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out. But you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies. Perhaps Robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when Josh Lewsey was driven over the Irish line near the end.\\n\\nLewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control. However, one has to credit Ireland flanker Johnny O\\'Connor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown. But in rugby, everything tends to even out over the 80 minutes. The referee also missed England\\'s Danny Grewcock taking out Ronan O\\'Gara off the ball to allow Martin Corry a Sunday stroll to the line. Those were the stand-out moments in a classic game between the two old foes.\\n\\nBut there were many more, and one should not take away from those. Brian O\\'Driscoll\\'s winning try was as well-conceived as they come, while Charlie Hodgson\\'s brilliant kicking display was another highlight. And Ronan O\\'Gara\\'s tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component. But the defining moments came with Ireland under the cosh in the final 15 minutes. Two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied England and allowed Ireland to hold on. The first was Denis Hickie\\'s brilliant double tackle in the right-hand corner. He gobbled up Cueto from another Hodgson cross-field kick, then regained his feet to stop Lewsey from scoring a certain try. Ireland\\'s second-row colossus Paul O\\'Connell was equally superb. England had turned Ireland one way then the other, and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating. England prop Matt Stevens ran in at full steam to suck in a few more tacklers. Unfortunately he ran into O\\'Connell who hit him hard - very hard - and then wrestled the ball away for a crucial turnover. That spoke volumes about Ireland\\'s back-foot display, with defensive coach Mike Ford taking a bow at the end. To win a game like that showed that Ireland have moved forward. It may be tries that win games, but it is defence that wins championships.\\nPietersen handed one-day call-up\\n\\nKevin Pietersen has been added to the England squad for the forthcoming one-day series in South Africa.\\n\\nThe Hampshire batsman, who was born in South Africa, made his England debut in Zimbabwe last November. \"It is prudent to add him to the squad as the team face seven one-day internationals in 15 days,\" said chairman of selectors David Graveney. \"His inclusion will give the captain and coach another option if the side requires a different balance.\" Pietersen spent four years qualifying to play for England after beginning his career in South African provincial cricket with KwaZulu-Natal. He was a prolific scorer in four seasons with Nottinghamshire and was the star of the England A tour to India early last year when he scored three centuries. His introduction to the senior side came on the controversial tour to Zimbabwe, where he showed his potential with an innings of 77 not out off 76 balls in the second match as England achieved a 4-0 clean sweep. But he can except a rough ride from South Africa, whose skipper Graeme Smith accused Pietersen of running out \"when things got tough\" in a magazine interview last autumn. \"If he didn\\'t want to be here, then we don\\'t want him here,\" Smith was quoted as saying. \"We all know that South Africa went through a transformation that wasimportant for our country. \"We had to come from apartheid and move on; there was always going to be a difficult stage. We all went through it and some fantastic cricketers haveemerged.\" The one-day series starts in Johannesburg on 30 January, three days after England\\'s sole warm-up game against South Africa A.\\n\\nM Vaughan (capt), Kabir Ali, J Anderson, G Batty, I Bell, P Collingwood, A Flintoff, A Giles, D Gough, S Harmison, G Jones (wkt), K Pietersen, V Solanki, A Strauss, M Trescothick, A Wharf.\\nWorld XI win Tsunami match\\n\\nTsunami Appeal match, Melbourne: ICC World XI 344-8 beat Asian 232 XI by 111 runs\\n\\nRicky Ponting hit 115 in a massive total of 344-8 after electing to bat first in front of a crowd of 70,101. Rahul Dravid top-scored with 75 not out in the Asian XI reply, after Virender Sehwag\\'s brisk 45. Daniel Vettori took 3-58 while England\\'s Darren Gough took a wicket and a catch. Shane Warne had 2-27. The game, broadcast in 122 countries to an estimated global television audience of one billion, began with a minute\\'s silence for the victims of the tsunami.\\n\\nAustralian Prime Minister John Howard tossed a coin to start the match. And afterwards the International Cricket Council chief executive, Malcolm Speed, paid tribute to the players for taking part. He said: \"This signifies the game\\'s compassion and commitment to provide as a much help as possible to enable the survivors of the Tsunami to rebuild their lives so far as this is possible.\" Ponting entertained the fans early on by hitting some big shots off Anil Kumble and Abdul Razzaq and the World XI\\'s run rate was soon ticking along at a healthy rate. Chris Cairns (69) and Brian Lara (52) enjoyed themselves as a middle order packed with stars delivered the goods.\\n\\nAnd there was plenty of time for the unorthodox - Australia tailender Glenn McGrath batted at number six, where he fell for a golden duck. Muttiah Muralitharan captured his wicket in overall figures of 3-59. It was a welcome comeback performance from the Sri Lankan who had been out injured for five months and who was almost caught up in the 26 December tragedy. Sehwag gave the Asian XI a good start as they reached 59-0 in the 10th over. But wickets regularly tumbled once he fell to a catch in the deep trying to hit Warne\\'s second ball for six.\\n\\nVettori got stuck into the middle order where Dravid played a lone hand with only Kumar Sangakkara - Gough\\'s sole victim - providing any meaningful support. The World XI were further boosted by the presence of Steve Waugh as a substitute fielder towards the end of the match. It was all wrapped up in the 40th over with the run out of Murali for a duck. Man of the match Ponting said: \"The whole day has been very, very special. \"It\\'s great that the cricket community around the world can play a huge part to raise some money to put a smile on some faces around the world.\" Asian XI captain Sourav Ganguly said: \"I hope we have contributed in whatever way we can to help the people who have suffered this disaster.\"\\n\\nSourav Ganguly (Ind/capt), Sanath Jayasuriya (SL), Virender Sehwag (Ind), Rahul Dravid (Ind), Yousuf Youhana (Pak), Kumar Sangakkara (SL), Abdul Razzaq (Pak), Chaminda Vaas (SL), Zaheer Khan (Ind), Anil Kumble (Ind), Muttiah Muralitharan (SL).

But the Sale full-back pulled out of the squad on Wednesday because of a torn ligament in his right thumb. The 30-year-old will undergo an operation on Friday but England have yet to name a replacement skipper.\\n\\nRobinson said: \"This is very disappointing for me as this means I miss England\\'s last two games in the Six Nations at Twickenham and two games for my club, Sale Sharks. \"But I\\'m looking to be back playing very early in April.\"\\n\\nRobinson picked up the injury in the 19-13 defeat to Ireland at Lansdowne Road on Saturday. And coach Andy Robinson said: \"I am hugely disappointed for Jason. \"As England captain he has been an immense figure during the autumn internationals and the Six Nations, leading by example at all times. I look forward to having him back in the England squad.\" The announcement is the latest setback for Robinson\\'s injury-depleted squad.\\n\\nAmong the key figures already missing are Jonny Wilkinson, Mike Tindall, Will Greenwood, Julian White and Phil Vickery - a list which leaves Robinson short on candidates for the now vacant captaincy role. Former England skipper Jeremy Guscott told BBC Radio Five Live his choice would be Matt Dawson, even though he is does not hold a regular starting place.\\n\\n\"The obvious choice is Dawson\" said Guscott. \"Especially given that Harry Ellis did not have his best game at scrum-half on Saturday. \"Dawson has the credentials and the experience, even though his winning record at captain is not great. \"The other option in Martin Corry, who is the standout forward at the moment. \"Unfortunately England cannot rely on leaders on the field at the moment.\" England will announce their squad for the 12 March game against Italy on Saturday.\\nItaly 8-38 Wales\\n\\nWales secured their first away win in the RBS Six Nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in Rome.\\n\\nTries from Jonathan Thomas, Tom Shanklin and Martyn Williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. Luciano Orquera did reply with one for Italy but second-half efforts from Brent Cockbain, Shane Williams and Robert Sidoli sealed victory. Fly-half Stephen Jones added four conversions as Wales maintained their superb start to this year\\'s tournament. Starting full of confidence after their victory over England, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. Diminutive wing Shane Williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing Andrea Masi and Aaron Persico into the Italian half. His pass to Tom Shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and Michael Owen\\'s long cut-out pass gave the lurking Thomas an easy run-in.\\n\\nStephen Jones, who retained the kicking duties despite Gavin Henson\\'s heroics against England, slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. Wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and Italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.\\n\\nHenson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for England, beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. But his attempted chip ahead was charged down by Orquera, who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. With the Welsh line-out stuttering and Italy twice turning the visitors\\' scrum, the home side\\'s forward power brought them back into it. But a clever high kick from Henson almost brought a try for Hal Luscombe when Roland de Marigny and Ludovico Nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.\\n\\nWales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try. Jones was unable to convert and De Marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for Italy. Henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal, but Wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.\\n\\nHenson sent Luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to Martyn Williams, the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post, Jones adding the conversion. Italy, who lost flanker Mauro Bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. De Marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a Nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. But Wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. Their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from Shane Williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock Cockbain. Before Italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from Gareth Thomas and great off-loads from Martyn Williams and replacement Kevin Morgan saw Shane Williams scamper over.\\n\\nWith Jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, Wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. The icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work, Shane Williams and Ceri Sweeney combining to send Sidoli over in the left corner. The only downside for Wales was a hamstring injury suffered by Luscombe. But after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years, they will travel to Paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders.\\n\\nR de Marigny; Mirco Bergamasco, W Pozzebon, A Masi, L Nitoglia; L Orquera, A Troncon; A Lo Cicero, F Ongaro, M Castrogiovanni, S Dellape, M Bortolami (capt), A Persico, Mauro Bergamasco, S Parisse.\\n\\nG Intoppa, S Perugini, CA del Fava, D dal Maso, P Griffen, M Barbini, KP Robertson.\\n\\nG Thomas (capt); H Luscombe, T Shanklin, G Henson, S Williams; S Jones, D Peel; G Jenkins, M Davies, A Jones; B Cockbain, R Sidoli; J Thomas, M Williams, M Owen.\\n\\nR McBryde, J Yapp, I Gough, R Sowden-Taylor, G Cooper, C Sweeney, K Morgan.\\n\\nAndrew Cole (Australia).\\nHarinordoquy suffers France axe\\n\\nNumber eight Imanol Harinordoquy has been dropped from France\\'s squad for the Six Nations match with Ireland in Dublin on 12 March.\\n\\nHarinordoquy was a second-half replacement in last Saturday\\'s 24-18 defeat to Wales.

Valbon, capped in last June\\'s Tests against the United States and Canada, was a second half replacement in the win over Scotland.\\n\\nFrance coach Bernard Laporte said Harinordoquy had been axed after a poor display last weekend. \"Imanol has been dropped from the squad because the least I can say is that he didn\\'t make a thundering comeback against Wales,\" said Laporte. \"We know the Ireland game will be fast and rough and we also want to be able to replace both locks during the game if needed, and Gregory Lamboley can also come on at number seven or eight. \"The grand slam is gone but we\\'ll go to Ireland to win. \"It will be a very exciting game because Ireland have three wins under their belt, have just defeated England and have their eyes set on a Grand Slam.\" France, who lost to Wales last week, must defeat the Irish to keep alive their hopes of retaining the Six Nations trophy.

But Williams said: \"I want to make it clear that I\\'m committed totally to Scottish rugby. \"I\\'ve brought my family here and we\\'ve immersed ourselves in Scottish life. There\\'s no way that I\\'m walking away.\" However, he attempted to steer clear of taking sides in the dispute. \"I\\'d like to stress that the national team is separate to the political situation,\" he said.\\n\\n\"When you come to an undertaking like this and you are trying to make a difference then there are always people who will begrudge you, who are jealous and want to try to drag you down. \"When you have that situation, you have to have the courage of your convictions to see it through. \"There was some very unhelpful and uninformed comment that the national team had received a massive increase in budget at the expense of other parts of Scottish rugby and that is simply not the case. \"Like all good coaches, you go and ask for an increase. But we were told in no uncertain terms that the financial situation did not allow that. \"The idea that we are lighting cigars with £20 notes while the rest of Scottish rugby flounders is absolutely untrue. \"We also attracted criticism because of the number of days players spent with the national team. \"But let me give you the truth. Our Irish counterparts, whom we have to compete with in a few days\\' time, had 70 days together at the summer. \"They are currently in camp now and they will have another 21 days in camp before the Six Nations. \"That means they will have 91 days away from their club from July until the Six Nations. We, on the other hand, will have 16. \"There must be a win-win philosophy and attitude within Scottish rugby and that is what we are after - both groups winning, not competing.\"\\nScotland 18-10 Italy\\n\\nSix Chris Paterson penalties gave Scotland victory in a dour but clinical encounter against Italy at Murrayfield.\\n\\nCoach Matt Williams\\' side were outmuscled and outplayed in a tense first half but led 6-3 at the break. Paterson slotted four more second-half penalties and Scotland were denied a try when wing Sean Lamont\\'s touchdown was ruled out for a forward pass. A late Andrea Masi try was small consolation for Italy, chasing their first away win in the Six Nations. Scotland came out on top of the early exchanges and took a quick 3-0 lead through the boot of full-back Paterson. But the more powerful Azzurri pack eventually rumbled into life.\\n\\nA series of drives into Scottish territory set up a penalty attempt, missed by full-back Roland De Marigny, and a wayward drop-goal effort from Luciano Orquera. Scotland defended the initial thrusts but on 20 minutes Italy, after coming up yards short of the line, equalised through a De Marigny penalty. Italy were offered another penalty when Scottish flanker Simon Taylor was offside but the left-footed De Marigny pushed his kick wide. Scotland finally made the most of a rare foray into the Italian half and snatched three points from Paterson when an Italian forward handled the ball in a ruck.\\n\\nAs the half wore on, both sides squandered promising spells of momentum with sloppy penalties, and the period fizzled out with Scotland numerically, if not psychologically, on top. Italy\\'s De Marigny narrowly missed a chance to level the scores again shortly after the break but his long-range kick shaved the right upright. And Scotland capitalised with a third Paterson penalty on 50 minutes. Williams\\' side seemed to have found a spark from somewhere and, after a couple of probing attacks, Paterson was able to slot another three points to widen the gap.\\n\\nWith the pendulum of possession swinging towards Scotland, Lamont thought he had wriggled over in the left corner after 65 minutes but play was recalled for a marginal forward pass from Paterson. Another Paterson penalty on 70 minutes kept the pressure on the wilting visitors. But John Kirwan\\'s men had the last laugh when Gordon Ross\\' attempted clearance was charged down and Masi pounced for the try, converted by De Marigny.\\n\\n: C Paterson; S Webster, A Craig, H Southwell, S Lamont; D Parks, C Cusiter; T Smith, G Bulloch (capt), G Kerr; S Grimes, S Murray; S Taylor, J Petrie, A Hogg.\\n\\nR Russell, B Douglas, N Hines, J Dunbar, M Blair, G Ross, B Hinshelwood.\\n\\nR de Marigny; Mirco Bergamasco, C Stoica, A Masi, L Nitoglia; L Orquera, A Troncon; A Lo Cicero, F Ongaro, M Castrogiovanni; S Dellape, M Bortolami (capt); A Persico, D Dal Maso, S Parisse.\\n\\nG Intoppa, S Perugini, CA del Fava, S Orlando, P Griffen, R Pedrazzi, KP Robertson.\\nWasps thrown out of Powergen Cup\\n\\nZurich Premiership champions Wasps have been disqualified from the Powergen Cup by the Rugby Football Union (RFU) for fielding an ineligible player.\\n\\nHooker Jonny Barrett played in Wasps\\' sixth-round 43-33 win over Bristol last weekend even though he was cup-tied. The ruling by the RFU is unprecedented in English rugby and means Bristol will take Wasps\\' quarter-final place against local rivals Gloucester on 22 January. Wasps have no plans to appeal against the decision. \"The club has admitted its mistake and needs to take the punishment like all clubs in this tournament,\" said Wasps chief executive David Davies.\\n\\n\"At this time of year, with other major games coming up, it was in everyone\\'s best interest to make a quick decision and allow us to concentrate on the upcoming fixtures against Gloucester and Biarritz in the Heineken Cup. \"We regret the deep embarrassment this incident causes to the club, our supporters and its players.\" During a loan spell at Henley earlier this season, Barrett took part in the club\\'s third-round defeat at the hands of Moseley on 16 October. Wasps director of rugby Warren Gatland then fielded the hooker against the Shoguns in contravention of RFU rules.\\n\\nThe mistake, described as \"an administrative oversight\", came to light after a joint investigation between Wasps and the RFU.\\n\\n\"We have accepted it as a mistake made on the part of the club,\" said RFU community and operations director Terry Burwell. \"The regulations are very clear, however, and we had no other option but to enforce them. The penalty will take effect for this season only.\" Wasps won English rugby\\'s premier domestic cup competition in 1999 and 2000. But the news they will not be able to advance this time around will further dent their ambitions this season. Wasps are struggling to maintain their Heineken Cup title defence after back-to-back defeats by Leicester earlier this month in the group stages. And the reigning domestic champions are second behind the Tigers in the Premiership.\\nUmaga ready for \"fearsome\" Lions\\n\\nAll Blacks captain Tama Umaga has warned the British and Irish Lions will be his most fearsome opponents yet ahead of their summer tour.\\n\\nBut Umaga, in England for Saturday\\'s IRB Rugby Aid match, also backed New Zealand to win the three-Test series against the Lions. He told BBC Sport: \"It\\'s potentially the most fearsome line-up I\\'ve ever come up against. They\\'re awesome. \"But I\\'d back us all the way to beat them when they come over.\" Lions boss Sir Clive Woodward is set to announce his squad for the June-July tour next month.\\n\\nWhen Woodward was appointed last year, it was widely believed he would rely heavily on his former England players. But Umaga said: \"He\\'d be hard pushed to do that now considering the shape of the Six Nations. \"Don\\'t get me wrong, England have got a lot of talented guys and I\\'m sure there are some of them who\\'ll make the Lions Test XV. \"But you can\\'t disguise Wales and Ireland in particular. Some of the tries they\\'ve scored have been great. I\\'ll admit it\\'ll be fairly awesome lining up against the likes of Brian O\\'Driscoll.\"\\n\\nUmaga will meet O\\'Driscoll in Saturday\\'s Rugby Aid match at Twickenham, with the Irish captain leading the Northern Hemisphere side. O\\'Driscoll is among a host of players in the Northern Hemisphere squad, coached by Woodward, that are tipped for Lions call-ups. \"It\\'ll be good for us to get an early idea of some of these guys, although a lot can change between now and June,\" Umaga said. The 31-year-old admitted interest in the Lions tour was immense, calling it \"the biggest thing to hit New Zealand since Lord of the Rings\". He added: \"As players, it\\'s enough for us to be driven by the rarity of playing the Lions. In fact, it\\'s not just us All Blacks - it\\'s the talk of the country.\"\\n\\nUmaga admitted the fear of injury weighed on his mind ahead of Saturday\\'s charity game, which features a host of big names including George Gregan, Andrew Mehrtens and Chris Latham. But he admitted the value of the cause - proceeds of the match will go to aiding victims of the tsunami - easily won him over. \"The second [Southern Hemisphere coach] Rod Macqueen made the approach, I didn\\'t hesitate. It was great when New Zealand Rugby then gave me the all clear. \"Thankfully I didn\\'t know anyone that was involved in the tragedy of the tsunami but you couldn\\'t miss all the horrific reports on the news. \"There are so many people that were affected, are still affected and will be affected for a long time. It\\'s just good to know we can do something minor to help out.\"\\n\\n- The match will be televised on BBC One at 1400 GMT on Saturday.\\nJohnson announces June retirement\\n\\nFormer England captain Martin Johnson has announced he is to retire from rugby union at the end of the season.\\n\\nJohnson, who captained England to World Cup glory in 2003, will play his final match in June. Johnson won 84 England caps and quit Test rugby at the start of 2004, just two months after leading Sir Clive Woodward\\'s team to victory in Sydney. The 34-year-old Leicester lock\\'s final match will be his testimonial at Twickenham on 4 June. \"I\\'m confident I have made the right decision to retire,\" said Johnson. \"I\\'m sure there will be times next season when I\\'ll wish I was out there playing for the Tigers, but you know when the time is right to go and I feel this is the right time. \"I feel physically that I could play for another season, but playing week in and week out in the Premiership is a full-time occupation and I only want to be out there for the right reasons.\" Johnson will always be revered by England fans for captaining England to their dramatic World Cup win against Australia in Sydney, but his list of achievements does not stop at that.\\n\\nHe is the only man to captain the Lions twice and he also led England to a Six Nations Grand Slam. Johnson also had huge success as captain of Leicester, guiding the Tigers to back to back Heineken Cup victories and several Premiership titles. Apart from his marvellous captaincy Johnson was also one of the finest second rows to ever play the game. Teak tough and physically intimidating, he ruled the rucks and mauls for the best part of a decade and was integral in England\\'s rise to the top of the world game. His final appearance will be in his testimonial at Twickenham, where he will lead a team against a side captained by New Zealand winger Jonah Lomu. The All Black is aiming to return to action after a kidney transplant and Johnson expects it to be a memorable occasion. \"This game against Jonah will be a great way to end the season and end my career,\" said Johnson. Lomu, rugby union\\'s first global superstar after his exploits in the 1995 World Cup, said he was proud to be part of Johnson\\'s farewell. \"We hold him in such high esteem,\" said Lomu. \"He is such a great leader and I am just honoured to be on the same pitch.\"\\nO\\'Shea to head up RFU Academies\\n\\nLondon Irish managing director Conor O\\'Shea is to leave the Exiles to take up a post as the Rugby Football Union\\'s Director of Regional Academies.\\n\\nO\\'Shea will start his new role in the spring, monitoring players capable of developing into England internationals. \"I look on this move to Twickenham as a huge challenge and one I simply could not turn down,\" O\\'Shea said. \"I can see so much potential for moving the academy network onto another level and that excites me enormously.\" O\\'Shea, who won 35 caps for Ireland at full-back, was forced to retire as player in 2001 after a series of ankle operations. He then became the Exiles\\' director of rugby before taking up the managing director role in 2003. O\\'Shea will manage the network of 14 England regional rugby academies, working closely with David Shaw, who has been instrumental in establishing the system, and Brian Ashton, who runs the National Academy in Bath.\\nWales make two changes for France\\n\\nWales coach Mike Ruddock has made two changes from the team that beat Italy 38-8 for Saturday\\'s trip to France.\\n\\nKevin Morgan takes over from his injured Newport-Gwent Dragons colleague Hal Luscombe on the right wing. And in the pack Neath-Swansea Ospreys forward Ryan Jones is preferred at blindside flanker to Jonathan Thomas. Thomas, a try-scorer in Rome, drops down to the bench instead of Ian Gough, while Cardiff back Rhys Williams steps up in place of Morgan. Luscombe is sidelined by a hamstring problem sustained during the Six Nations game against Italy last weekend.\\n\\nHowever, the experienced and in-form Morgan was already pushing hard for a start at Stade de France. \"Due to his impressive performances from the bench, Kevin was very much in the selection mix anyway, and the unfortunate injury to Hal gives him the chance to start,\" said Ruddock. \"Now that Ryan Jones has recovered from injury, we have increased the options in the back row. \"Jonathan Thomas is unlucky to lose his spot after performing well against Italy and scoring a try, but such is the competition for places that every position is debated in detail. \"For this particular game, we felt we might not always be afforded the open spaces out wide we were able to exploit against Italy, so an extra big ball-carrier in the back-row is thought to be necessary on this occasion. \"Obviously, it\\'s a 22-man game these days, and there is every chance that Jonathan will be making an impact from the bench.\" Wales have beaten France on two of their last three visits to Paris, and another victory this time around would keep them firmly on course for a first Five or Six Nations title triumph since 1994. \"Graham Henry (former Wales coach) said a couple of years ago that we should \\'be bold\\' when going to France, and he was proved right,\" said Ruddock. \"That is a great way to approach the game, and something we will further endorse with the players this week.\"\\n\\nG Thomas (Toulouse, capt); K Morgan (Newport-Gwent), T Shanklin (Cardiff), G Henson (Neath-Swansea), S Williams (Neath-Swansea); S Jones (Clermont Auvergne), D Peel (Llanelli); G Jenkins (Cardiff), M Davies (Gloucester), A Jones; (Neath-Swansea), B Cockbain (Neath-Swansea), R Sidoli (Cardiff); R Jones (Neath-Swansea), M Williams (Cardiff), M Owen (Newport-Gwent).\\n\\nReplacements: R McBryde (Llanelli), J Yapp (Cardiff), J Thomas (Neath-Swansea), R Sowden-Taylor (Cardiff), G Cooper (Newport-Gwent), C Sweeney Newport-Gwent), R Williams (Cardiff).\\nFuming Robinson blasts officials\\n\\nEngland coach Andy Robinson insisted he was \"livid\" after his side were denied two tries in Sunday\\'s 19-13 Six Nations loss to Ireland in Dublin.\\n\\nMark Cueto\\'s first-half effort was ruled out for offside before the referee spurned TV replays when England crashed over in the dying minutes. \"[I\\'m] absolutely spitting. I\\'m livid. There\\'s two tries we\\'ve been cost,\" Robinson told BBC Sport. \"We\\'ve got to go back to technology. I don\\'t know why we didn\\'t.\" South African referee Jonathan Kaplan ruled that Cueto was ahead of Charlie Hodgson when the fly-half hoisted his cross-field kick for the Sale wing to gather.\\n\\nKaplan then declined the chance to consult the fourth official when Josh Lewsey took the ball over the Irish line under a pile of bodies for what could have been the game-winning try. \"I think Mark Cueto scored a perfectly legal try and I think he should have gone to the video referee on Josh Lewsey,\" said Robinson. \"It is how we use the technology. It is there, and it should be used. \"I am still trying to work out the Cueto try. I have looked at both, and they both looked tries. \"We are very disappointed, and this will hurt, there is no doubt about that. \"We are upset now, but the referee is in charge and he has called it his way and we have got to be able to cope with that.\\n\\n\"We did everything we could have done to win the game. I am very proud of my players and, with a couple of decisions, this could have been a very famous victory. \"I thought we dominated. Matt Stevens had an awesome game at tighthead prop, while the likes of Charlie Hodgson, Martin Corry and Lewis Moody all came through well. \"Josh Lewsey was awesome, and every one of the forwards stood up out there. Given the pressure we were under, credit must go to all the players. \"We have done everything but win a game of rugby, but Ireland are a good side. They defended magnificently and they\\'ve got every chance of winning this Six Nations.\" England have lost their first three matches in this year\\'s Six Nations and four out of their six games since Robinson took over from Sir Clive Woodward in September.\\nIreland 19-13 England\\n\\nIreland consigned England to their third straight Six Nations defeat with a stirring victory at Lansdowne Road.\\n\\nA second-half try from captain Brian O\\'Driscoll and 14 points from Ronan O\\'Gara kept Ireland on track for their first Grand Slam since 1948. England scored first through Martin Corry but had \"tries\" from Mark Cueto and Josh Lewsey disallowed. Andy Robinson\\'s men have now lost nine of their last 14 matches since the 2003 World Cup final. The defeat also heralded England\\'s worst run in the championship since 1987. Ireland last won the title, then the Five Nations, in 1985, but 20 years on they share top spot in the table on maximum points with Wales. And Eddie O\\'Sullivan\\'s side banished the ghosts of 2003 when England were rampant 42-6 victors in claiming the Grand Slam at Lansdowne Road. In front of a supercharged home crowd on a dry but blustery day in Dublin, Ireland tore into the white-shirted visitors from the kick-off and made their intentions clear when O\\'Gara landed a fourth-minute drop-goal.\\n\\nEngland took their time to settle but their first real venture into Ireland\\'s half produced a simple score for Corry. The number eight picked up the ball from the back of a ruck and found an absence of green jerseys between himself and the Irish line, racing 25 yards to touch down. England fly-half Charlie Hodgson nailed the conversion from out on the left, but almost immediately O\\'Gara, winning his 50th cap, answered with two penalties in quick succession. England were awarded a penalty of their own on the halfway line after 20 minutes, and Hodgson, the villain at Twickenham, coolly bisected the posts. The first quarter was marked by periods of tactical kicking, but it was Ireland who were showing more willingness to spread the ball wide to their eager and inventive backs. A series of probes led by the talismanic O\\'Driscoll, back from hamstring injury, resulted in a penalty but Ireland chose to kick for touch.\\n\\nFrom the line-out, the ball was recycled back to O\\'Gara, who stroked his second drop-goal, this time off the right upright. As the interval approached, wing Josh Lewsey was the catalyst for England\\'s most promising attack. The Wasps star raced up his touchline and Hodgson\\'s cross-kick put in Mark Cueto for an apparent score, but the Sale wing was ruled to have started in front of the kicker. England began the second half well and had Ireland pinned in their own half. But another English indiscretion on a rare Irish break-out awarded O\\'Gara a kick at goal, which he missed. England\\'s pressure continued, and a wave of attacks saw centre Jamie Noon dragged down yards from the line before Hodgson landed a drop-goal.\\n\\nThe lead was shortlived, however. Ireland raced upfield, deft handling from the backs, including a clever dummy from Geordan Murphy on Hodgson, ending with O\\'Driscoll going over in the right corner and touching down close to the posts. O\\'Gara missed a penalty which would have put Ireland nine points clear, and the home crowd breathed a sigh of relief when Hodgson\\'s cross-kick was fumbled by lock Ben Kay near the line. Anticipation of a home win sent the noise level sky-high, but O\\'Gara missed another chance to seal the game with a wayward drop-goal attempt. Inside the last 10 minutes, England poured forward, spurred on by scrum-half Matt Dawson, who replaced Leicester\\'s Harry Ellis. But despite one near miss with the pack over the line - not checked on the TV replay by referee Jonathan Kaplan - England were unable to pull off a face-saving win. Ireland next face France at Lansdowne Road in two weeks\\' time before the potential title decider against Wales in Cardiff. England are still to meet Italy at Twickenham, in what is now a wooden spoon decider, and Scotland.\\n\\nG Murphy; G Dempsey, B O\\'Driscoll, S Horgan, D Hickie; R O\\'Gara, P Stringer; R Corrigan, S Byrne, J Hayes; M O\\'Kelly, P O\\'Connell; S Easterby, J O\\'Connor, A Foley.\\n\\nF Sheahan, M Horan, D O\\'Callaghan, E Miller, G Easterby, D Humphreys, K Maggs.\\n\\nJ Robinson (capt); M Cueto, J Noon, O Barkley, J Lewsey; C Hodgson, H Ellis; G Rowntree, S Thompson, M Stevens; D Grewcock, B Kay; J Worsley, L Moody, M Corry.\\n\\nA Titterrell, D Bell, S Borthwick, A Hazell, M Dawson, A Goode, O Smith.\\nWilkinson return \\'unlikely\\'\\n\\nJonny Wilkinson looks set to miss the whole of the 2005 RBS Six Nations.\\n\\nEngland\\'s World Cup-winning fly-half said last week he was hoping to recover from his latest injury in time to play some role in the championship. But Rob Andrew, coach of Wilkinson\\'s club side Newcastle, said that with only two games left to play Wilkinson was unlikely to be fit in time. \"It would be irresponsible to put him straight into a Test match,\" Andrew told the Times. Wilkinson is recovering from a knee injury which followed long-term neck and arm injuries. He has not played for England since the World Cup final in November 2003, since when the stuttering world champions have lost nine of their 14 matches. Wilkinson is aiming to make his third start to the season in the Zurich Premiership match against Harlequins on 13 March.\\n\\nThat game is the day after England play Italy in the Six Nations and six days before their final match of the championship against Scotland. \"We are hoping Jonny will be ready in a fortnight, but it is touch and go,\" said Andrew. \"His recovery is going very well and the key now is how he is reintroduced to playing and with it goal-kicking. \"He will probably have to come off the bench to start and it would be ridiculous and irresponsible to put him straight back into a Test match. \"We can\\'t afford to get it wrong with a knee injury. We are in touch with England and they are relaxed about it.\" Despite not playing for England, Wilkinson is still hoping to make the Lions tour to New Zealand this summer. Lions coach Sir Clive Woodward has not set a deadline for when Wilkinson has to start playing again in order to be considered for selection.\\nRobinson ready for difficult task\\n\\nEngland coach Andy Robinson faces the first major test of his tenure as he tries to get back to winning ways after the Six Nations defeat by Wales.\\n\\nRobinson is likely to make changes in the back row and centre after the 11-9 loss as he contemplates Sunday\\'s set-to with France at Twickenham. Lewis Moody and Martin Corry could both return after missing the game with hamstring and shoulder problems. And the midfield pairing of Mathew Tait and Jamie Noon is also under threat. Olly Barkley immediately allowed England to generate better field position with his kicking game after replacing debutant Tait just before the hour. The Bath fly-half-cum-centre is likely to start against France, with either Tait or Noon dropping out.\\n\\nTait, given little opportunity to shine in attack, received praise from Robinson afterwards, even if the coach admitted Cardiff was an \"unforgiving place\" for the teenage prodigy. Robinson now has a tricky decision over whether to withdraw from the firing line, after just one outing, a player he regards as central to England\\'s future. Tait himself, at least outwardly, appeared unaffected by the punishing treatment dished out to him by Gavin Henson in particular. \"I want more of that definitely,\" he said. \"Hopefully I can train hard this week and get selected for next week but we\\'ll have to look at the video and wait and see. \"We were playing on our own 22 for a lot of the first half so it was quite difficult. I thought we defended reasonably well but we\\'ve just got to pick it up for France.\"\\n\\nHis Newcastle team-mate Noon hardly covered himself in glory in his first major Test. He missed a tackle on Michael Owen in the build-up to Wales\\' try, conceded a penalty at the breakdown, was turned over in another tackle and fumbled Gavin Henson\\'s cross-kick into touch, all inside the first quarter. His contribution improved in the second half, but England clearly need more of a playmaker in the inside centre role. Up front, the line-out remains fallible, despite a superb performance from Chris Jones, whose athleticism came to the fore after stepping into the side for Moody. It is more likely the Leicester flanker will return on the open side for the more physical challenge posed by the French forwards, with Andy Hazell likely to make way. Lock Ben Kay also justified his recall with an impressive all-round display on his return to the side, but elsewhere England positives were thin on the ground.\\nWales coach elated with win\\n\\nMike Ruddock paid tribute to his Wales side after they came from 15-6 down to beat France 24-18 in the Six Nations.\\n\\n\"After going two tries down in 12 minutes we had to show character,\" said the national team coach. \"I didn\\'t have to tell them anything at half-time because those players have stared down the barrel of a gun before. \"They decided they didn\\'t want to do that again and came out fighting. It was a great team effort and we showed great character to come back.\" Man-of-the-match Stephen Jones, who kicked three penalties, a drop goal and conversion, was ecstatic following after the win at Stade de France.\\n\\n\"It\\'s just a special moment. Two years ago we didn\\'t win a single game in the Six Nations. But we\\'re a very happy camp now,\" he said. \"We worked hard as a squad and I\\'m a proud Welshman. We\\'ve got hard matches to come, so we\\'re just happy with the start.\" Double try scorer Martyn Williams was keen not to talk about a possible Grand Slam for Wales. \"We\\'ve got more self-belief these days. Two or three years ago we might have collapsed after going behind so early. \"There\\'s no mention of a Grand Slam among the players. We\\'ve got a tough game against Scotland at Murrayfield. They could bring us crashing down to earth.\"\\nFear will help France - Laporte\\n\\nFrance coach Bernard Laporte believes his team will be scared going into their game with England on Sunday, but claims it will work in their favour.\\n\\nThe French turned in a stuttering performance as they limped to a 16-9 win against Scotland in the opening match of the Six Nations on Saturday. \"We will go to Twickenham with a little fear and it\\'ll give us a boost,\" said the French coach. He added: \"We are never good enough when we are favourites.\" Meanwhile, Perpignan centre Jean-Philippe Granclaude is delighted to have received his first call-up to the France squad. \"It\\'s incredible,\" the youngster said. \"I was not expecting it at all. \"Playing with the France team has always been a dream and now it has come true and I am about to face England at Twickenham in the Six Nations.\" Laporte will announce his starting line-up on Wednesday at the French team\\'s training centre in Marcoussis, near Paris.\\nYachvili savours France comeback\\n\\nFrance scrum-half Dimitri Yachvili praised his team after they fought back to beat England 18-17 in the Six Nations clash at Twickenham.\\n\\nYachvili kicked all of France\\'s points as they staged a second-half revival. \"We didn\\'t play last week against Scotland and we didn\\'t play in the first half against England,\" he said. \"But we\\'re very proud to beat England at Twickenham. We were just defending in the first half and we said we had to put them under pressure. We did well.\" Yachvili admitted erratic kicking from England\\'s Charlie Hodgson and Olly Barkley, who missed six penalties and a drop goal chance between them, had been decisive. \"I know what it\\'s like with kicking. When you miss some it\\'s very hard mentally, but it went well for us,\" he said. France captain Fabien Pelous insisted his side never doubted they could secure their first win against England at Twickenham since 1997. France were 17-6 down at half-time, but Pelous said: \"No-one was down at half-time, we were still confident. \"We said we only had 11 points against us, which was not much. \"The plan was to keep hold of possession and pressure England to losing their composure.\" France coach Bernard Laporte accepted his side had not played well. \"We know we have to play better to defend the title,\" he said. \"I\\'m not happy we didn\\'t score a try but we\\'re happy because we won.\"\\nO\\'Driscoll/Gregan lead Aid stars\\n\\nIreland\\'s Brian O\\'Driscoll will lead the Northern Hemisphere team in the IRB Rugby Aid match at Twickenham.\\n\\nO\\'Driscoll heads a star-studded cast for the contest to raise funds for the tsunami appeal. The South will be led by George Gregan, one of four Wallabies, alongside five Springboks and four All Blacks including captain Tana Umaga. South African flanker Schalk Burger has shaken off a leg injury to take his place in the starting line-up. He will join fellow Springboks John Smit, Cobus Visagie and Victor Matfield in the South pack, with Jacque Fourie among the centres. The North side have been hit by the withdrawals of Scotland duo Gordon Bulloch and Chris Cusiter, plus France captain Fabien Pelous.\\n\\nBut Leicester\\'s England centre Ollie Smith has been added to the squad, giving him an opportunity to impress Lions coach Sir Clive Woodward, who takes charge of the North side. \"I think it\\'s fantastic for Ollie,\" Tigers coach John Wells told BBC Radio Leicester. \"He was probably going to have the weekend off this week and I hope Clive gets the chance to see the qualities that Leicester and England have been seeing all year.\" Woodward will also assess other potential Lions candidates such as Scotland pair Simon Taylor and Chris Paterson, Wales scrum-half Dwayne Peel and Ireland lock Paul O\\'Connell. \"I\\'m looking forward to working with such outstanding players,\" Woodward said. \"Both teams are fielding top-quality sides and I really hope that the rugby public and community get behind this game to raise as much money as possible for such a deserving cause.\" Despite the withdrawal of Wales wing Rhys Williams, who is required for the Blues\\' Celtic League match with Munster, three other members of their Six Nations squad - Ceri Sweeney, John Yapp and Jonathan Thomas - will also play. \"Not only it is for a good cause but it gives these players the opportunity to play with and against some of the best players in the world,\" said WRU general manager Steve Lewis. Supporters can watch the teams train for free at Twickenham on Friday, 4 March. Woodward will put his North team through their paces at 1030 GMT, with the South side, coached by former Wallabies coach Rod Macqueen, due at the stadium at 1330.\\n\\nC Paterson (Scotland), B Cohen (England), B O\\'Driscoll (Ireland, capt), D Traille (France), O Smith (England), C Sweeney (Wales), D Humphreys (Ireland), D Peel (Wales); A Lo Cicero (Italy), P de Villiers (France), J Yapp (Wales), R Ibanez (France), P O\\'Connell (Ireland), M Bortolami (Italy), J Thomas (Wales), S Taylor (Scotland), L Dallaglio (England), S Parisse (Italy), Others to be added.\\n\\nC Latham (Australia); B Lima (Samoa), J Fourie (SA) T Umaga (New Zealand), S Bobo (Fiji); A Mehrtens (NZ) G Gregan (Aus, capt); C Hoeft (NZ), J Smit (SA), C Visagie (SA), S Maling (NZ), V Matfield (SA), S Burger (SA), P Waugh (Aus), T Kefu (Aus).\\n\\nE Taukafa (Tonga), E Guinazu (Argentina), S Sititi (Samoa), O Palepoi (Samoa), M Rauluni (Fiji), T Delport (SA), A N Other.\\nIreland 17-12 South Africa\\n\\nRonan O\\'Gara scored all Ireland\\'s points as the home side claimed only their second ever win over South Africa on an emotional day at Lansdowne Road.\\n\\nO\\'Gara\\'s first-half try, poached after a quick tap-penalty, helped the Irish to a 8-3 lead at half-time. Three further O\\'Gara penalties extended Ireland\\'s lead to 17-6 as the game entered the final quarter. Two Percy Montgomery penalties set up a frantic finish but Ireland held out to claim a famous victory. Ireland began strongly and were never led, but the match was tense and closely fought throughout. Aware of the threat posed by the South Africans, Ireland pressed hard from the outset, and played some impressive rugby while searching for a breakthrough. Early on, Denis Hickie thought he was in for a try after a delightful backline move but Shane Horgan\\'s pass was adjudged to have gone forward by referee Paul Honiss.\\n\\nIreland continued to press and they showed their intent by opting for a line-out in the 19th minute when three straight-forward points were on offer. Another South African infringement a minute later led to Ireland\\'s first points - O\\'Gara took a quick tap-penalty and charged over the opposition line for an Irish try. The Springboks could feel hard done by as captain John Smit had his back to the play when O\\'Gara pounced after referee Honiss had told the skipper to warn his own players after consistent infringements. Stung by the score, the South Africans almost replied with a try of their own within 60 seconds with Geordan Murphy\\'s ankle-tap tackle denying a certain try for Percy Montgomery. However, the Springboks did win a penalty a minute later which Montgomery easily slotted to cut Ireland\\'s lead to 5-3.\\n\\nIreland got out of jail when the South Africans had a three-to-one overlap near the Irish line only to waste the chance. After the sustained Springboks pressure, the Irish produced an attack of their own in the 34th minute which culminated with O\\'Gara\\'s clever drop-goal to restore his side\\'s lead to five points which remained the margin at half-time. Sustained Irish pressure immediately after half-time was rewarded by another O\\'Gara penalty. However, Montgomery responded quickly by slotting over a superb penalty from near the right touchline to cut Ireland\\'s lead to five points again. Montgomery then burst through the Irish defence in the 48th minute and it took a superb Girvan Dempsey tackle to prevent a try. The South Africans suffered a double-blow in the 52nd minute when Schalk Burger was sin-binned for the second week in a row after killing the ball and O\\'Gara punished the transgression by notching another penalty.\\n\\nIn the 61st minute, Hickie was left frustrated by a poor pass from Girvan Dempsey as a chance to seal the match was wasted. However, a late tackle on Brian O\\'Driscoll enabled O\\'Gara to notch another penalty in the 63rd minute which extended Ireland\\'s lead to 17-6. However, two Montgomery penalties had Ireland\\'s lead in peril again as the Springboks closed to within five points with seven minutes remaining. South Africa produced a huge effort in the closing minutes but Ireland held on to claim a deserved victory.\\n\\nG Dempsey; G Murphy, B O\\'Driscoll (capt), S Horgan, D Hickie; R O\\'Gara, P Stringer; R Corrigan, S Byrne, J Hayes, M O\\'Kelly, P O\\'Connell, S Easterby, J O\\'Connor, A Foley.\\n\\nF Sheahan, M Horan, D O\\'Callaghan, E Miller, G Easterby, D Humphreys, K Maggs.\\n\\n: P Montgomery; B Paulse, M Joubert, De Wet Barry, A Willemse, J van der Westhuyzen; F Du Preez; O Du Randt, J Smit (captain), E Andrews, B Botha, V Matfield, S Burger, AJ Venter, J van Niekerk.\\n\\n: H Shimange, CJ van der Linde, G Britz, D Rossouw, M Claassens, J de Villiers, G du Toit/J Fourie.\\n\\nPaul Honiss (New Zealand)\\nCaptains lining up for Aid match\\n\\nIreland\\'s Brian O\\'Driscoll is one of four Six Nations captains included in the Northern Hemisphere squad for the IRB Rugby Aid match on 5 March.\\n\\nFrance\\'s Fabien Pelous, Gordon Bullock of Scotland and Italy\\'s Marco Bortolami are also in the Northern party.

Italy led 9-8 early in the second half but Stringer\\'s try gave Ireland a lead they never lost. The hosts cut the gap to 18-12 with 10 minutes left and nearly scored through Ludovico Nitoglia, but Denis Hickie\\'s try ensured an Irish victory. Italy came flying out of the blocks and took the lead through a Luciano Orquera penalty after seven minutes.\\n\\nIt could have been better for the hosts but the fly-half missed two kickable penalties and Ireland drew level with a Ronan O\\'Gara penalty midway through the first half. The Italians were driving at the heart of the Irish defence and, for the first quarter, the Irish pack struggled to secure any ball for their talented backs.\\n\\nWhen they finally did, just before the half-hour mark, O\\'Driscoll promptly created a sparkling try for Murphy. The Ireland captain ran a dummy scissors and made a magical outside break before drawing the full-back and putting the diving Murphy in at the corner. O\\'Gara missed the twice-taken conversion and the visitors found themselves trailing once again. Roland de Marigny took over the kicking duties for Italy from the hapless Orquera, and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge Italy into a 9-8 lead.\\n\\nThe only Ireland player offering a real threat was O\\'Driscoll, and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors. Shane Horgan threw an overhead pass as he was about to be forced into touch and Stringer scooted over, with O\\'Gara landing the tricky conversion. A penalty apiece saw Ireland leading 18-12 as the game entered the final quarter, but they were lucky to survive when Italy launched a series of attacks. Winger Nitoglia dropped the ball as he reached for the line and Italy nearly rumbled over from a driving maul.\\n\\nAn O\\'Gara penalty put Ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when Hickie latched onto an inside pass from Murphy and crossed for a converted try. O\\'Driscoll limped off late on, joining centre partner Gordon D\\'Arcy on the sidelines, and the final word went to Italy. Prop Martin Castrogiovanni powered over for a try which was fitting reward for an Italian pack which had kept the Irish under pressure throughout.\\n\\nDe Marigny; Mi Bergamasco, Canale, Masi, Nitoglia; Orquera, Troncon; Lo Cicero, Ongaro, Castrogiovanni; Dellape, Bortolami; Persico, Ma Bergamasco, Parisse.\\n\\nPerugini, Intoppa, Del Fava, Dal Maso, Griffen, Pozzebon, Robertson.\\n\\nMurphy, Horgan, O\\'Driscoll, D\\'Arcy, Hickie, O\\'Gara, Stringer, Corrigan, Byrne, Hayes, O\\'Kelly, O\\'Connell, S Easterby, Leamy, Foley.\\n\\nSheahan, Horan, O\\'Callaghan, Miller, G Easterby, Humphreys, Dempsey.\\n\\nP O\\'Brien (New Zealand)\\nSculthorpe wants Lions captaincy\\n\\nPaul Sculthorpe has admitted he would love to succeed Andy Farrell as Great Britain skipper if the Wigan star does switch codes to rugby union.\\n\\nSculthorpe was vice-captain in the Tri-Nations, and took the St Helens captaincy from Chris Joynt last year. \"I would definitely want the job - I make no bones about it,\" Sculthorpe told BBC Sport. \"It\\'s something I\\'ve always wanted to do. I\\'d gladly take it if it was offered to me.\"\\n\\nThe 27-year-old, who captained St Helens to Challenge Cup success last year, said following in the footsteps of Farrell would be a challenge. \"Andy would be a hard act to follow but it\\'s something I\\'m confident of being up to,\" he said. \"The GB team isn\\'t a one-man team. There are a lot of good young players who are pushing for places anyway.\"\\n\\nSculthorpe said the rugby league world would understand if Farrell did decide to move to rugby union. \"It\\'s a short career and you have to make of it what you can,\" said Sculthorpe. \"Nobody can blame him if he does go - he\\'s done everything in the game of rugby league.\\n\\n\"Financially it could set him up for life. If he fancies a new challenge, then who could fault him?\" Sculthorpe also called on the rugby league authorities to have a serious look at the number of games the top players are being asked to play. Sean Long, Sculthorpe\\'s Saints and Lions team-mate, has expressed doubts about his international future \"I think Sean\\'s situation is to do with the sheer number of games we\\'re playing,\" he said.\\n\\n\"The way he\\'s looking at it is that if he can extend his career by a couple of years by not playing international rugby, then he\\'s willing to do that. \"The RFL has got to do something about the fixtures. We\\'re playing 42 weeks of the year and it\\'s too much. \"A lot of the niggly injuries that I\\'ve suffered with over the last couple of years have come about because of the lack of rest time.\" St Helens have been strongly linked with a move for brilliant young forward Sonny Bill Williams, and Sculthorpe said he would love the 19-year-old to come to Knowsley Road. \"He\\'s a great player - a big strong lad who can certainly hit hard in defence, but who is also very skilful,\" he said. \"I\\'d love him to come to St Helens. Who knows what might happen? But you want the best players in your team, and he\\'s certainly one of the best players in the world.\"\\nMurray returns to Scotland fold\\n\\nEuan Murray has been named in the Scotland training squad after an eight-week ban, ahead of Saturday\\'s Six Nations match with Ireland.\\n\\nThe Glasgow forward\\'s ban for stamping ended on 2 February. \"I\\'m just happy to be back playing and be involved with the squad,\" said Murray on Monday. \"Hopefully I can get a couple of games under my belt and I might have a chance of playing later in the Six Nations.

Dragons three-quarter Hal Luscombe takes Shanklin\\'s wing berth. Up front, Mefin Davies plays at hooker, open-side Martyn Williams is fit to start and lock Rob Sidoli replaces veteran Gareth Llewellyn. Davies wins the vote ahead of Robin McBryde, who sits on the bench having recently returned to action for the Scarlets following a neck injury.\\n\\nSidoli is back for the first time since last season\\'s Six Nations, the Blues second row back to form after a niggling groin problem. Williams, Sidoli\\'s team-mate at Cardiff, is set to win his 50th cap, replacing the injured Colin Charvis after making a quicker-than-expected recovery from a neck disc problem. \"Initially when I had the diagnosis it was a case of trying to get fit for the Italy game next week, but fortunately my recovery has been a lot quicker than we all hoped,\" Williams told BBC Sport Wales. \"I haven\\'t started a game since 1 January and would have preferred to have a couple of games in the lead-up to this, but the good thing with the injury is that I have kept up my fitness levels. \"I feel quite fresh and I just can\\'t wait to play again.\" Williams says he expects a torrid time from an England loose-forward trio of Lewis Moody, Joe Worsley and Andy Hazell. \"They are three top-class players, especially Worsley and Moody. They have been there and done it,\" Williams added. \"They were back-ups behind Richard Hill, Neil Back and Lawrence Dallaglio, but now they have come forward and proved what good players they are - there are no weaknesses there.\" Luscombe gets the nod on the wing ahead of Dragons team-mate Kevin Morgan, who wins a place on the bench alongside uncapped Blues prop John Yapp.\\n\\nG Thomas (Toulouse (capt); H Luscombe (Dragons), T Shanklin (Blues), G Henson (Ospreys), S Williams (Ospreys); S Jones (Clermont Auvergne), D Peel (Scarlets); G Jenkins (Blues), M Davies (Gloucester), A Jones (Ospreys), B Cockbain (Ospreys), R Sidoli (Blues), D Jones (Scarlets), M Williams (Blues), M Owen (Dragons).\\n\\nR McBryde (Scarlets), J Yapp (Blues), J Thomas (Ospreys), R Jones (Ospreys), G Cooper (Dragons), C Sweeney (Dragons), K Morgan (Dragons).\\nBorders 19-20 Ulster\\n\\nUlster clung on for a morale-boosting Celtic League win over bottom club Borders at Netherdale on Friday night.\\n\\nA late try by Borders substitute Jonny Weston had set up a dramatic finish, but the Scottish side could not complete the fightback. Ulster had led 20-6 with tries from Paul Steinmetz and Bryn Cunningham. But the Irish province failed to add to the tally in the second half and ended up relieved to get the win to lift them to eighth place in the table. Borders had edged ahead with a sixth-minute penalty by Charlie Hore - only to hand the visitors the initiative via a gift try. Calum MacRae surrendered possession before centre Steinmetz sent a chip into the danger zone. Substitute Joe Pattison - who had come on for the injured Gareth Morton - wrongly thought the ball was trickling out of play and eased up on the chase.\\n\\nThe speedy Steinmetz had other ideas and he raced up to get the vital touch in the nick of time, giving Adam Larkin an easy conversion. Ally Warnock clawed back three points for Borders, but they were soon hit by another double-blow. First, Mark Blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full-back Cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper Andy Ward. Larkin again added the extras. Even worse was to come for Borders when Larkin kicked two more penalties just before the break, the second of which also led to Kelly Brown being sin-binned. The hosts gave themselves a glimmer of hope immediately after the restart, however, when Warnock struck a penalty at the other end. And he repeated the feat to set up the tense finale. Ulster coach mark McCall said he was delighted to get the victory. \"Borders are a tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had a victory in some time,\" said McCall. \"In the first 20 minutes we were edgy but in the second 20 minutes we played some of our best rugby this season and scored two good tries.\"\\n\\nMorton, Moffat, MacRae, Hore, Berthinussen, Warnock, Moore, Thomson, Ford, Douglas, Blair, Stewart, Gray, Brown, McEntee.\\n\\nKay, Parr, McGee, Rennick, Weston, Millar, Pattison.\\n\\nCunningham, Maxwell, Bell, Steinmetz, Howe, Larkin, Campbell, S.

Sonny Parker is continuing to struggle with a neck injury, but Hal Luscombe should be fit for the Murrayfield trip. Centre Parker has only a \"slim chance\" of being involved against the Scots on 13 March, so Luscombe\\'s return to fitness after missing the France match with hamstring trouble is a timely boost.\\n\\nSaid Wales assistant coach Scott Johnson: \"We\\'re positive about Hal and hope he\\'ll be raring to go. \"He comes back into the mix again, adds to the depth and gives us other options. \" Replacement hooker Robin McBryde remains a doubt after picking up knee ligament damage in Paris last Saturday. \"We\\'re getting that reviewed and we should know more by the end of the week how Robin\\'s looking,\" added Johnson. \"We\\'re hopeful but it\\'s too early to say at this stage.\" Steve Jones from the Dragons is likely to be drafted in if McBryde fails to recover.\\nDawson wins England squad recall\\n\\nWasps scrum-half Matt Dawson has been recalled to England\\'s training squad ahead of the RBS Six Nations and been reinstated in the Elite Player Squad.\\n\\nCoach Andy Robinson dropped Dawson for the autumn Tests after he missed training to film \\'A Question of Sport.\\' \"I always said I would consider bringing Matt back if I felt he was playing well,\" Robinson said. \"He merits his return on current form.\" Newcastle\\'s 18-year-old centre Mathew Tait is also in the training squad. \"It\\'s obviously an honour to be asked to train with England,\" said Tait, who has burst into contention recently. \"I look forward to going down and doing the sessions, but the most important thing at the moment is Sunday\\'s game against Newport, so I\\'m not looking any further than that.\" Robinson has invited 42 players to attend a three-day session in Leeds next week, in which his squad will train in part with the Leeds Rhinos rugby league squad.\\n\\nWith Mike Tindall ruled out of the opening two matches and Will Greenwood sidelined for the entire Six Nations, Tait is one of six or seven contenders for the two centre berths. Stuart Abbott, Jamie Noon, Ollie Smith, Olly Barkley and Henry Paul - who retains his place despite his early substitution against Australia - are also in the mix. Ben Cohen could also be considered after switching from the wing for his club Northampton recently. Prop Phil Vickery and lock Simon Shaw both return to the squad after missing the autumn Tests through injury, while Wasps wing Tom Voyce is recalled. The group also includes Bath flanker Andy Beattie and Leicester hooker George Chuter. \"Beattie has matured greatly as a player these past two seasons,\" Robinson said. Jonny Wilkinson, Tindall and Martin Corry have all been included despite their unavailability for the opening two matches against Wales and France.\\n\\nThe revised 56-man elite squad includes Wasps hooker Phil Greening, who replaces the retired Mark Regan, and Sale wing Mark Cueto. Cueto was selected for the November internationals despite not being part of the group, but scored four tries in three England appearances. Leicester scrum-half Harry Ellis has also been promoted from the senior national academy, and will contest the number nine jersey with Dawson and Gloucester\\'s Andy Gomarsall. The players in Robinson\\'s elite squad can only play 32 matches for club and country. They can be called up for a total of 16 training days in addition to the recognised international weeks for each of the years leading up to the next World Cup.\\n\\nBalshaw, Cohen, Cueto, Lewsey, Robinson, Simpson-Daniel, Voyce, Abbott, Noon, Paul, Smith, Tait, Tindall, Barkley, Hodgson, King, Wilkinson, Dawson, Ellis, Gomarsall.\\n\\nChuter, Thompson, Titterrell, Rowntree, Sheridan, Stevens, Vickery, White, Borthwick, Brown, L Deacon, Grewcock, Kay, Shaw, Beattie, Corry, Forrester, Hazell, Jones, Moody, Vyvyan, J Worsley.\\n\\nAbbott, Balshaw, Borthwick, A Brown, Chuter, Cohen, Corry, Cueto, Dawson, Ellis, Flatman, Gomarsall, Greening, Greenwood, Grewcock, Hazell, Hill, Hodgson, Kay, King, Lewsey, Moody, Noon, Paul, Robinson, Rowntree, Shaw, Simpson-Daniel, Thompson, Tindall, Titterrell, Vickery, Vyvyan, White, Wilkinson, J Worsley, M Worsley.\\n\\nBarkley, Beattie, Christophers, L Deacon, Forrester, C Jones, Palmer, Rees, Sheridan, Skinner, Smith, Stevens, Tait, Voyce.\\n\\nDowson, Haughton, Monye, Roques, P Sanderson.\\nWales silent on Grand Slam talk\\n\\nRhys Williams says Wales are still not thinking of winning the Grand Slam despite a third Six Nations win.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the last thing on our minds at the moment,\" said Williams, a second- half replacement in Saturday\\'s 24-18 win over France in Paris. \"We all realise how difficult a task it is to go up to Scotland and beat them. \"We\\'ve come unstuck there a couple of times recently so our focus is on that game and we\\'ll worry about Ireland hopefully after we\\'ve beaten Scotland.\" With captain Gareth Thomas ruled out of the rest of the campaign with a broken thumb, Williams is vying for his first start in the championship so far.\\n\\nKevin Morgan is probably favourite to replace Thomas at full-back, leaving Williams and Hal Luscombe to battle for the right wing berth. A hamstring injury denied Luscombe the opportunity to make a third successive start, but the Dragons winger is expected to be fit for the trip to Murrayfield on 13 March. Hooker Robin McBryde is doubtful after picking up a knee injury in Paris, but centre Sonny Parker and flanker Colin Charvis are set to recover from injury to be in contention for selection. Said Wales assistant coach Scott Johnson: \"They\\'ve worked through the weekend and the reports are a bit more positive. \"So we\\'re getting a couple back and that adds to the depth of the squad.\" Scotland secured their first win of the campaign on Saturday by grinding out an 18-10 win over Italy.\\n\\nMatt Williams\\' side has shown little in attack, but Johnson insisted the Scots will be difficult opposition to break down. \"Italy are really brave opposition and sometimes it\\'s very hard to win,\" he said. \"So an ugly win can be just as effective as a 30 or 40 point victory. \"Scotland are a hard side and very underrated so we\\'re not taking anything for granted. \"We\\'re not basking in the glory of winning our first three games. We\\'ve got to be diligent in our preparation. \"That\\'s my job and we\\'ve got to make sure we\\'re focused.\"\\nScotland v Italy (Sat)\\n\\nMurrayfield, Edinburgh\\n\\nSaturday, 26 February\\n\\n1400 GMT\\n\\nBBC1, Five Live and this website\\n\\nVictory for the Azzurri in Rome last year saw Scotland end their campaign without a victory.

Italy have lost both their opening games at home to Ireland and Wales, but travel to Edinburgh with high hopes.\\n\\nTheir coach John Kirwan has warned his side they must eradicate the errors that blighted their loss to Wales however or risk suffering a third successive defeat. \"If the defeat against Wales has taught us anything, it\\'s that at this level we can\\'t make any mistakes,\" Kirwan said. \"In the Six Nations, every error you make will come at a high price. \"We have to be aggressive for 80 minutes, keep calm in every situation and display great maturity on the pitch.\\n\\n\"It will be fundamental to keep cool in the difficult moments - in the key situations of the game.\" Kirwan has recalled the experienced Cristian Stoica at centre and drafted in David dal Maso at open-side after star flanker Mauro Bergamasco was ruled out for the rest of the tournament. Scotland have also made two changes, Simon Webster replacing Simon Danielli on the wing and Simon Taylor returning for his first Test in a year, for injured flanker Jason White. Taylor\\'s recovery from a serious knee injury is a major boost to Scottish hopes. \"He is one of the world-class players in the tournament and you want them in your team,\" acknowledged Williams.\\n\\nDespite a record of only two victories from 14 Tests, Williams insists he is revelling in the pressure. \"I actually really enjoy seeing how you cope with such pressure as a coach,\" he said, optimistic despite opening defeats to France and Ireland. \"We were confident for those two first games and we are confident we can beat Italy too,\" he added.\\n\\n: C Paterson; S Webster, A Craig, H Southwell, S Lamont; D Parks, C Cusiter; T Smith, G Bulloch (capt), G Kerr; S Grimes, S Murray; S Taylor, J Petrie, A Hogg.\\n\\nR Russell, B Douglas, N Hines, J Dunbar, M Blair, G Ross, B Hinshelwood.\\n\\nR de Marigny; Mirco Bergamasco, C Stoica, A Masi, L Nitoglia; L Orquera, A Troncon; A Lo Cicero, F Ongaro, M Castrogiovanni; S Dellape, M Bortolami (capt); A Persico, D Dal Maso, S Parisse.\\n\\nG Intoppa, S Perugini, CA del Fava, S Orlando, P Griffen, R Pedrazzi, KP Robertson.\\nO\\'Gara revels in Ireland victory\\n\\nIreland fly-half Ronan O\\'Gara hailed his side\\'s 19-13 victory over England as a \"special\" win.\\n\\nThe Munster number 10 kicked a total of 14 points, including two drop goals, to help keep alive their Grand Slam hopes. He told BBC Sport: \"We made hard work of it but it\\'s still special to beat England. \"I had three chances to win the game but didn\\'t. We have work to do after this but we never take a victory over England lightly.\" Ireland hooker Shane Byrne echoed O\\'Gara\\'s comments but admitted the game had been England\\'s best outing in the Six Nations. Byrne said: \"It was a really, really hard game but from one to 15 in our team we worked really, really hard. \"We just had to stick to our defensive pattern, trust ourselves and trust those around us. All round it was fantastic.\" Ireland captain Brian O\\'Driscoll, who scored his side\\'s only try, said: \"We are delighted, we felt if we performed well then we would win but with England also having played very well it makes it all the sweeter. \"We did get the bounce of the ball and some days that happens and you\\'ve just got to jump on the back of it.\"\\n\\nIreland coach Eddie O\\'Sullivan was surprised that England coach Andy Robinson said he was certain Mark Cueto was onside for a disallowed try just before the break. \"Andy was sitting two yards from me and I couldn\\'t see whether he was offside or not so I don\\'t know how Andy could have known,\" said O\\'Sullivan.\\n\\n\"What I do know is that England played well and when that happens it makes a very good victory for us. \"We had to defend for long periods and that is all good for the confidence of the team. \"I think our try was very well worked, it was a gem, as good a try as we have scored for a while.\" O\\'Sullivan also rejected Robinson\\'s contention England dominated the forward play. \"I think we lost one lineout and they lost four or five so I don\\'t know how that adds up to domination,\" he said. O\\'Driscoll also insisted Ireland were happy to handle the pressure of being considered favourites to win the Six Nations title. \"This season for the first time we have been able to play with the favourites\\' tag,\" he said. \"Hopefully we have proved that today and can continue to keep doing so. \"As for my try it was a move we had worked on all week. There was a bit of magic from Geordan Murphy and it was a great break from Denis Hickie.\"\\nSaint-Andre anger at absent stars\\n\\nSale Sharks director of rugby Philippe Saint-Andre has re-opened rugby\\'s club-versus-country debate.\\n\\nSale host Bath in the Powergen Cup on Friday, but the Frenchman has endured a \"difficult week\" with six players away on England\\'s Six Nations training camp. \"It\\'s an important game but we\\'ve just the one full session. It\\'s the same for everyone but we need to manage it. \"If five players or more are picked for your country they should move the date of the game,\" he told BBC Sport. Unless the authorities agree to make changes, Saint-Andre believes England\\'s national team will suffer as clubs opt to sign foreigners and retired internationals. \"That\\'s not good for the politics of the English team or for English rugby,\" he argues. It is an issue he has taken up before, most notably during the autumn internationals when Sale lost all three Zurich Premiership matches they played.\\n\\nNow he fears it could derail the club\\'s hopes of cup silverware after eight players, including captain Jason Robinson and fly-half Charlie Hodgson, were away with their countries. \"We\\'re in the quarter-finals, it\\'s always better to play at home than away and it\\'s a great opportunity,\" he added. \"But we have to be careful. Bath have just been knocked out of Europe and will make it a tough game. It also comes at the end of a very, very difficult week. \"Sebastien Bruno\\'s been with France, Jason White with Scotland and there are six with England, that\\'s eight players plus injuries - 13 players out of a squad of 31. \"We\\'ll have just one session together and will have to do our best to make that a good one on Thursday afternoon.\"\\n\\nGloucester have also been caught in a club-versus-country conflict after England sought a second medical opinion on James Simpson-Daniel\\'s fitness. The winger is carrying a shoulder injury and the national team management believe he requires time on the sidelines. As a result he misses the Cherry and White\\'s quarter-final at home to Bristol. \"Under the Elite Player Squad agreement, England wanted a second opinion, which they can do,\" director of rugby Nigel Melville told the Gloucester Citizen.\\n\\n\"They obviously want him for international rugby and we want him for club rugby in what is a very important game for us. There is a conflict of interests. \"The surgeon who carried out his operation said he was fine for us but England say he is still vulnerable to be damaged again and want him on a full rehab programme.\" Simpson-Daniel added: \"I\\'ve said to Nigel I want to be back playing and that means if everything goes well this week, I can target the Worcester game (on 29 January) for a return.\"\\nDallaglio his own man to the end\\n\\nControversy and Lawrence Dallaglio have never been very far away from each other throughout a glittering international career.\\n\\nEven the end of his nine-year career came out of the blue, just four days before the start of the season. But then Dallaglio has always been his own man. Ever since emerging onto the international scene Dallaglio has polarised opinions. To supporters of England, Dallaglio could do no wrong. An integral part of a sustained period of success for England, Dallaglio\\'s crowning glory was his part in the side that won the Rugby World Cup in 2003.\\n\\nRival fans, meanwhile, have tended to take an alternative view, seeing Dallaglio as the epitome of the less agreeable characteristics of English rugby. Never afraid to speak his mind, be it to the referee or the opposition on the pitch, or his coach or the media off it, Dallaglio has sometimes rubbed people up the wrong way. Dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded England side which became the shock winners of the first Rugby Sevens World Cup in 1993. It took him another two years to graduate to the full England XV, but once there he proved to the manor born. Displaying maturity and physical power beyond his years, Dallaglio rapidly established himself as an automatic choice able to play any one of the three back-row positions at international standard.\\n\\nWithin two years of his debut, Dallaglio was offered the England captain\\'s band, and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the 1997 Lions tour to South Africa. Although overlooked for the captaincy in favour of England team-mate Martin Johnson, he played a massive role in the 2-1 series victory. But after building up a seemingly unstoppable momentum, Dallaglio\\'s career hit the buffers at speed in 1999.\\n\\nFirst came the last-minute defeat to Wales in which Dallaglio\\'s decision not to kick for goal in the dying minutes was blamed for costing England a Grand Slam. Worse was to follow though as an infamous newspaper sting cost him his treasured England captaincy. With sensational allegations of drug use - of which he was subsequently cleared - splashed across the front pages, a devastated Dallaglio stepped down as England skipper. But he bounced back, getting his head down at club level before returning to the England fold, albeit now as a lieutenant to new captain Johnson. As a member of a new-look England side on the long road to World Cup glory - a journey not without mishaps as a succession of Grand Slams opportunities were spurned - Dallaglio emerged as a key performer once again.\\n\\nYet another setback arrived in 2001 as a serious knee injury cut short Dallaglio\\'s involvement on the Lions tour to Australia.\\n\\nRumours began to circulate that his career was over but, in typical Dallaglio style, he embarked on a punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen. One effect of the injury was to rob Dallaglio of much of his pace, but ever the pragmatist, he reinvented himself as a close quarters number eight of the highest calibre.\\n\\nThe only player to play every minute of England\\'s World Cup triumph in Australia, Dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure England\\'s historic win, and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by England supporters. Following Johnson\\'s retirement, Dallaglio\\'s career came full circle as Woodward restored him as England captain. While England did not hit the heights in Dallaglio\\'s second spell as captain, losing five of their eight post-World Cup Tests, Dallaglio led by example, leaving him as one of the few members of a squad lacking many World Cup stars to live up to expectations. Dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of England\\'s most accomplished players, if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country.\\n\\nThe problem now for England is how to replace the almost irreplaceable. The likes of Matt Dawson, Jonny Wilkinson, Phil Vickery and Hill have all been mentioned as contenders for Dallaglio\\'s role as captain. But it is as a player that England will really struggle to replace the 32-year-old. Although players like Joe Worsley and Chris Jones are more than capable of stepping up, the fact that there is no stand-out candidate speaks volumes about Dallaglio\\'s massive influence on English rugby.\\nBarkley fit for match in Ireland\\n\\nEngland centre Olly Barkley has been passed fit for Sunday\\'s Six Nations clash with Ireland at Lansdowne Road.\\n\\nBarkley withdrew from Bath\\'s team for Friday\\'s clash with Gloucester after suffering a calf injury in training. Gloucester centre Henry Paul has also been cleared to play after overcoming an ankle injury. England coach Andy Robinson, who names his team on Wednesday, has called up Bath prop Duncan Bell following Phil Vickery\\'s broken arm. With Vickery sidelined for at least six weeks and Julian White out with a neck injury, Bell could make his England debut. Bell, 30, had set his sights on an international career with Wales. But last December, the International Rugby Board confirmed that he could only be eligible for England as he had travelled on tour with them in 1998. \"I thought I\\'d burned all my bridges with England when I expressed an interest in wanting to play for Wales, so it\\'s fantastic to get this opportunity,\" he said. Bell, who featured in the England A side which beat France 30-20 10 days ago, added: \"I recognise that I got into the England A squad because of injuries. \"And it\\'s the same again in getting into the senior squad. But now that I have this opportunity I intend to take it fully if selected and play my heart out for my country.\"\\n\\nEngland coach Andy Robinson could take a gamble and call inexperienced Sale Sharks prop Andrew Sheridan into his front row. But Sheridan favours the loosehead side of the scrum and a more likely scenario is for uncapped Bell - who was among the try-scorers when England A beat France A 30-20 nine days ago - to be drafted in.\\nDal Maso in to replace Bergamasco\\n\\nDavid dal Maso has been handed the task of replacing the injured Mauro Bergamasco at flanker in Italy\\'s team to face Scotland on Saturday.\\n\\nAlessandro Troncon continues at scrum-half despite the return to fitness of Paul Griffen. The experienced Cristian Stoica is recalled at centre at the expense of Walter Pozzebon. \"We are going to Scotland for the first away win and nothing else,\" said manager Marco Bollesan. \"I really believe this is the team who will have all our faith for Saturday\\'s game. \"We lost a player like Mauro Bergamasco who has been important for us, but (coach) John (Kirwan) has put together the best team at present, if not ever.\\n\\nR de Marigny (Parma); Mirco Bergamasco (Stade Francais), C Stoica (Montpellier), A Masi (Viadana), L Nitoglia (Calvisano); L Orquera (Padova), A Troncon (Treviso); A Lo Cicero (L\\'Aquilla), F Ongaro (Treviso), M Castrogiovanni (Calvisano), S Dellape (Agen), M Bortolami (Narbonne, capt), A Persico (Agen), D dal Maso (Treviso), S Parisse (Treviso).\\n\\nG Intoppa (Calvisano), S Perugini (Calvisano), CA Del Fava (Parma), S Orlando (Treviso), P Griffen (Calvisano), R Pedrazzi (Viadana), K Robertson (Viadana).\\nIreland 21-19 Argentina\\n\\nAn injury-time dropped goal by Ronan O\\'Gara stole victory for Ireland from underneath the noses of Argentina at Lansdowne Road on Saturday.\\n\\nO\\'Gara kicked all of Ireland\\'s points, with two dropped goals and five penalties, to give the home side a 100% record in their autumn internationals. An impressive Argentina appeared in control until the dying seconds. The Pumas shocked the Irish early on with a try from Federico Aramburu, and Felipe Contepomi kicked 14 points. The well-drilled and sharper Pumas out-played and out-thought Ireland in the early stages. Indiscipline allowed Argentina\\'s Leinster fly-half Contepomi to open the scoring in the third minute with a straightforward penalty. He was on the mark again two minutes later when Argentina shocked a ragged Ireland with the first try of the game. Ireland turned the ball over and Manuel Contepomi broke through an unstructured defence before feeding his midfield partner Aramburu to sprint in under the posts. O\\'Gara finally got Ireland on the board with a dropped goal in the ninth minute only for Contepomi to rifle over his second penalty two minutes later. Playing into a strong wind and rain, Ireland continued to come second best in tight situations, and turnovers began to mount up against a rugged defence. O\\'Gara managed to land his second penalty in the 36th minute, but once again Contepomi replied in kind four minutes into first-half injury time. The second-half started as the first had ended. O\\'Gara rifled over another penalty in the 45th minute, but Contepomi matched it three minutes later. The upper-body strength of the Pumas never allowed Ireland to take control up front, while the three-quarters had no space to manoeuvre. Ireland had to rely on O\\'Gara\\'s boot to keep in touch rather than any contrived running plays. The Munsterman landed two more penalties - one of them from 48 metres - to bring his team to within four points with 13 minutes on the clock remaining. And Ireland\\'s chance came when Argentina\\'s number eight Gonzalo Longo was yellow carded with six minutes to go for an offence in the line-out. O\\'Gara made no mistake as he rifled over his fifth penalty to set up a tense final few minutes. But Ireland showed great composure to get themselves into a position to allow O\\'Gara to thump over a massive drop goal to complete a tremendous, if fortuitous, comeback.\\n\\nDawson joins England injury list\\n\\nScrum-half Matt Dawson is an injury doubt for England\\'s Six Nations opener against Wales next weekend.\\n\\nThe World Cup winner missed Wasps\\' 12-9 loss to Bath on Saturday after injuring his right calf. Wasps coach Warren Gatland said: \"He\\'s got a fitness test in the week but he\\'s got a good chance of playing.\" Gloucester\\'s Andy Hazell and Leicester star Lewis Moody also received knocks during their respective league matches, but should be fit for Wales next week. If Dawson is not fit to face Wales, Robinson will have to choose from Gloucester\\'s Andy Gomarsall or Leicester youngster Harry Ellis.\\n\\nJamie Noon is another player on the sidelines after he limped off in the first half against Saracens on Friday with a dead leg. The centre, who is in line for a first Six Nations start against Wales, will have to wait 48 hours before knowing the state of his injury.\\nIreland v USA (Sat)\\n\\nSaturday 20 November\\n\\nLansdowne Road, Dublin\\n\\n1300 GMT\\n\\nThe Irish coach knows a repeat of the record 83-3 victory over the States in 2000 is not on the agenda and expects a real test at Lansdowne Road. \"Their coach Tom Billups will have them very organised,\" said O\\'Sullivan. \"They ran five tries past the French in the summer, so we will not take them for granted. We have guys coming into the team who are chomping at the bit.\" The Irish line-up shows nine changes from the team which started against South Africa with winger Tommy Bowe and flanker Denis Leamy making their international debuts. The other changes see recalls for backs David Humphreys, Kevin Maggs and Guy Easterby with Eric Miller, Marcus Horan, Donnacha O\\'Callaghan and Frank Sheehan all returning to the pack.\\n\\nO\\'Sullivan said the players coming in had the opportunity to stake claims for inclusion against Argentina on 27 November. Easterby gets a rare start at scrum-half while Humphreys, now effectively Ronan O\\'Gara\\'s deputy at fly-half, wins his 65th cap. \"We have got to get the focus right on the day,\" said Ulster man Humphreys. \"The US may be classed as weaker opposition, but we will treat them with the respect they deserve.\" The States lost 39-31 against France in their last international and are ranked 16th in world rugby. The Americans have made three changes, plus one positional switch from the game in July against the French. Lock Alec Parker, blind-side flanker Brian Surgener and right wing Al Lakomskis return and captain Kort Schubert of the Cardiff Blues shifts to number eight. Schubert is the only Eagles player remaining from the sides\\' meeting four years ago.\\n\\nG Murphy; S Horgan, B O\\'Driscoll (capt), K Maggs, T Bowe; D Humphreys, G Easterby; M Horan.

It\\'s not just the Irish, but Welsh and English players as well.\" The 31-year-old former Dublin milkman moved from Leinster to Toulouse in 2003 and immediately picked up a Heineken Cup winner\\'s medal in an all-French final against Perpignan at Lansdowne Road.\\n\\nBrennan is highly-rated at Stade Toulousain, where he is used anywhere in the back five. Woodward is ensuring his preparations for the trip to New Zealand in June are as thorough as possible. \"I\\'ve spoken to quite a few players, and they probably don\\'t know what they\\'re actually saying when we\\'re having these conversations,\" he told the newspaper. \"But you talk about certain players and they\\'ll say if they think they\\'re up to scratch or that they don\\'t want them in their team. \"I haven\\'t heard a bad word said against Trevor, which, considering he has a pretty tough guy reputation, is, to me, impressive.\"\\nHealey targets England comeback\\n\\nLeicester wing Austin Healey hopes to use Sunday\\'s return Heineken Cup clash with Wasps as a further springboard to an England recall for the Six Nations.\\n\\nHealey, who won 51 caps prior to the 2003 World Cup, has been in good form in the Tigers\\' resurgence this season. \"I definitely still have ambitions to play for England,\" Healey told the BBC. \"We will have to see what happens after the previous (autumn) Tests but when I look at the current squad I definitely feel there is a place there for me.\" Healey, who has also played both half-back positions and full-back during his career, has reverted to the wing, where he won most of his England caps. After recovering from a trapped nerve in his back sustained at the end of September, the 31-year-old is relishing his role in the Tigers revival. \"I had six weeks out but fortunately I have resumed the sort of form I had before,\" he said.\\n\\n\"I am basically playing where it best suits Leicester. Obviously I can play scrum-half, fly-half or full-back at a moment\\'s notice. \"But playing on the wing actually gives me a bigger free role to come in where I am not expected and influence things.\" That has been apparent in parts one and two of the Wasps-Leicester trilogy in recent weeks. First, Healey came off his flank with an angled run to score an injury-time try that earned the Tigers a 17-17 draw in their Premiership meeting on 21 November. Then, in the first of their Heineken cup double header last Sunday, Healey slotted in at stand-off and delivered a superb cross-kick for Martin Corry to score the Tigers\\' third try. \"I caught \\'Cozza\\'s\\' eye a couple of phases before that and was hoping to get it to him on the full, but fortunately even with the bounce he managed to score,\" Healey recalled.\\n\\nHealey, twice a Heineken Cup winner, believes last Sunday\\'s match was \"up there\" with some of the biggest club contests he has played in. \"It was a very intense occasion and a very destructive game,\" he recalled. \"There was not a huge amount of rugby played but it was a great game to be involved in. \"After about 15 minutes I thought we might stride away with it but Wasps really came back into it and in the last couple of minutes it could have gone either way.\"\\n\\nThe same outcome this Sunday would put Leicester in pole position to top their Heineken pool with a home game against Biarritz and away trip to Calvisano to come. But Healey insists the Tigers must summon the same desire if they are to deliver the knockout blow in what has been dubbed \"rugby\\'s version of Rocky II\". \"There was a lot of satisfaction in the dressing room aftewards but it is really only a case of a job half done,\" he added. \"It was the first of a two-leg trip and if we lose at Welford Road it will negate all the positives we can take from result. \"I think it came down to who wanted it more and in the end I think we did. We have got to show the same desire again this week.\"\\nHodgson shoulders England blame\\n\\nFly-half Charlie Hodgson admitted his wayward kicking played a big part in England\\'s 18-17 defeat to France.\\n\\nHodgson failed to convert three penalties and also missed a relatively easy drop goal attempt which would have given England a late win. \"I\\'m very disappointed with the result and with my myself,\" Hodgson said. \"It is very hard to take but it\\'s something I will have to get through and come back stronger. My training\\'s been good but it just didn\\'t happen.\" Hodgson revealed that Olly Barkley had taken three penalties because they were \"out of my range\" but the centre could not convert his opportunities either, particularly the drop goal late on. \"It wasn\\'t a good strike,\" he added. \"I felt as soon as it hit my boot it had missed. It\\'s very disappointing, but I must recover.\" Andy Robinson said he would \"keep working on the kicking\" with his squad. However, the England coach added that he would take some positives from the defeat.\\n\\n\"We went out to play and played some very good rugby and what have France done?\" he said. \"They won the game from kicking penalties from our 10m line. \"It\\'s very frustrating. The lads showed a lot of ambition in the first half, they went out to sustain it in the second but couldn\\'t build on it. \"We took the ball into contact, and you know when you do that it is a lottery whether the referee is going to give the penalty to your side or the other side. \"We have lost a game we should have won. There is a fine line between winning and losing, and for the second week we\\'ve been on the wrong side of that line and it hurts.\"\\n\\nEngland went in at half-time with a 17-6 lead but they failed to score in the second half and Dimitri Yachvili slotted over four penalties as France overhauled the deficit. England skipper Jason Robinson admitted his side failed to cope with France\\'s improved second-half display.\\n\\n\"We controlled the game in the first half but we knew that they would come out and try everything after half-time,\" he said. \"We made a lot of mistakes in the second half and they punished us. They took their chances when they came. \"It\\'s very disappointing. Last week we lost by two points, now one point.\"\\nWilkinson fit to face Edinburgh\\n\\nEngland captain Jonny Wilkinson will make his long-awaited return from injury against Edinburgh on Saturday.\\n\\nWilkinson, who has not played since injuring his bicep on 17 October, took part in full-contact training with Newcastle Falcons on Wednesday. And the 25-year-old fly-half will start Saturday\\'s Heineken Cup match at Murrayfield on the bench. But Newcastle director of rugby Rob Andrew said: \"He\\'s fine and we hope to get him into the game at some stage.\" The 25-year-old missed England\\'s autumn internationals after aggravating the haematoma in his upper right arm against Saracens. He was subsequently replaced as England captain by full-back Jason Robinson. Sale\\'s Charlie Hodgson took over the number 10 shirt in the internationals against Canada, South Africa and Australia. Wilkinson\\'s year has been disrupted by injury as his muscle problem followed eight months on the sidelines with a shoulder injury sustained in the World Cup final.\\nScrum-half Williams rejoins Bath\\n\\nBath have signed their former scrum-half Andy Williams on a short-term deal from the Neath-Swansea Ospreys.\\n\\nWales international Williams, whose contract with the Welsh region was due to expire in June, has agreed a contract until the end of the season. With Martyn Wood\\'s injury likely to keep him out until February, Bath need experienced back-up to Nick Walshe. Said Williams: \"When this opportunity presented itself, I did not really have to think twice about it.\" Williams, capped by Wales against Romania in 2003, should figure in the match squad for Monday\\'s Zurich Premiership match at Sale Sharks. He lost his Ospreys starting place to New Zealander Jason Spice and has fallen further behind in the pecking order. The Welsh region has two outstanding young No 9 prospects in Richie Rees and Rhodri Wells. Bath director of rugby Jack Rowell, though, believes Williams fits the bill perfectly. \"He has been playing regular Heineken Cup and Celtic League rugby and he has a great affection for Bath,\" Rowell told Bath\\'s official website. \"We are delighted to be able to welcome him back to the club.\"\\nCall for Kenteris to be cleared\\n\\nKostas Kenteris\\' lawyer has called for the doping charges against the Greek sprinter to be dropped.\\n\\nGregory Ioannidis has submitted new evidence to a Greek athletics tribunal which he claims proves the former Olympic champion has no case to answer. Kenteris and compatriot Katerina Thanou were given provisional suspensions in December for failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics. The Greek tribunal is expected to give its verdict early next week. Kenteris and Thanou withdrew from the Athens Olympics last August after missing drugs tests on the eve of the opening ceremony. They were also alleged to have avoided tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago before the Games.\\n\\nBut Ioannidis said: \"Everything overwhelmingly shows that the charges should be dropped.\" Ioannidis also said he has presented evidence that will throw a different light on the events leading up to the pair\\'s sensational withdrawal from the Athens Games. The lawyer added that he has proof the authorities \"knew\" Kenteris was in Germany at the time he was alleged to have missed a test in Chicago. Nick Davies, spokesman for athletics\\' ruling body the IAAF, which handed out the provisional bans, said: \"We can\\'t comment because we were not present at the hearing and don\\'t know what was said behind closed doors. \"We expect a verdict from the Greek Athletics Federation before the end of February and will obviously be making a statement then.\" Kenteris won 200m gold at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, while Thanou won silver in the 100m.\\nThanou desperate to make return\\n\\nGreek sprinter Katerina Thanou says she is eager to compete again after being cleared of missing a drugs test by an independent Greek tribunal.\\n\\nThanou, 30, was provisionally suspended for missing a test before the Olympics, but the decision was overturned. \"The IAAF will decide if we can compete again in Greece and abroad,\" Thanou told To Vima newspaper in her first interview since the Athens Olympics. \"If given the green light I will run again - that\\'s the only thing I want.\" Thanou, 30, and her compatriot Kostas Kenteris were provisionally suspended by the IAAF in December for missing three drugs tests. The third was alleged to have been on the eve of the opening ceremony of the Athens Olympics.\\n\\nBut an independent tribunal of the Greek Athletics Federation overturned the provisional ban on 18 March. The IAAF - which said it was \"very surprised\" by the decision of the Greek tribunal - is deciding whether to appeal against the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. However, Dick Pound, the chairman of the World Anti-Doping Authority, has said he will appeal against the decision if the IAAF does not. And Thanou and Kenteris face a criminal trial later this year for allegedly avoiding the test and then faking a motorcycle accident. Thanou said: \"I can see how people can think the accident seemed like a childish excuse. \"I cannot deny that we made a lot of mistakes during that time. I always said we needed a PR person. \"An athlete would have to be very stupid to take illegal substances when he or she knows that they will undergo tests at any given moment. \"I am a champion. I cannot risk everything I\\'ve achieved in such a silly way.\"\\nEdwards tips Idowu for Euro gold\\n\\nWorld outdoor triple jump record holder and BBC pundit Jonathan Edwards believes Phillips Idowu can take gold at the European Indoor Championships.\\n\\nIdowu landed 17.30m at the British trials in Sheffield last month to lead the world triple jump rankings. \"It\\'s all down to him, but if he jumps as well as he did in Sheffield he could win the gold medal,\" said Edwards. \"His ability is undoubted but all his best performances seem to happen in domestic meetings.\"\\n\\nIdowu made his breakthrough five years ago but so far has only a Commonwealth silver medal to his name. Edwards himself kept Idowu off top spot at the Manchester Games. But he believes the European Indoors in Madrid represent a chance for the 26-year-old to prove his credentials as Britain\\'s top triple jumper. \"He has to start producing at international level and here is the beginning,\" said Edwards. \"Phillips still needs to be much more consistent. I\\'m sure a victory in Madrid will build up his confidence and self-belief that he can be best in the world.\" The qualifying round of the men\\'s triple jump in Madrid takes place on Friday with the final scheduled for Saturday. Olympic champion Christian Olsson will not be taking part as he is out for the entire indoor season with an ankle injury.\\nGreek duo cleared in doping case\\n\\nSprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou have been cleared of doping offences by an independent tribunal.\\n\\nThe duo had been provisionally suspended by the IAAF for allegedly missing three drugs tests, including one on the eve of the Athens Olympics. But the Greek Athletics Federation tribunal has overturned the bans - a decision which the IAAF can now contest at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The pair\\'s former coach, Christos Tzekos, has been banned for four years. Kenteris, 31, and Thanou, 30, had been charged with avoiding drug tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and failing to notify anti-doping officials of their whereabouts before the Olympics. They withdrew from the Olympics after missing a drugs test at the Olympic Village on 12 August.\\n\\nThe pair then spent four days in a hospital, claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. It was the International Olympic Committee\\'s demand that the IAAF investigate the affair that led to the hearing of the Greek tribunal. The head of that tribunal, Kostas Panagopoulos, said it had not been proven that the athletes refused to take the test in Athens. \"The charge cannot be substantiated,\" he said. \"In no way was he (Kenteris) informed to appear for a doping test. The same goes for Thanou.\" Kenteris\\'s lawyer, Gregory Ioannidis, said: \"The decision means Mr Kenteris has been exonerated of highly damaging and unfounded charges which have been extremely harmful for his career.\\n\\n\"He has consistently maintained his innocence and this was substantiated by further evidence we were able to submit to the tribunal following its deliberations in January. \"This evidence shows Mr Kenteris was never asked to submit to a test by the International Olympic Committee so he could not possibly have been guilty of deliberately avoiding one. It shows he has no case to answer. \"Mr Kenteris should now be given the opportunity he deserves to rebuild his career in the full knowledge that there is no stain on his character. \"He has suffered greatly throughout this ordeal that has exposed both himself and his family to enormous pressures.\" But the IAAF said it was \"very surprised\" by the verdict. Spokesman Nick Davies said: \"We note the decision of the Greek authorities with interest. \"Our doping review board will now consider the English version of the decision.\"\\nIsinbayeva claims new world best\\n\\nPole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva broke her own indoor world record by clearing 4.89 metres in Lievin on Saturday.\\n\\nIt was the Russian\\'s 12th world record of her career and came just a few days after she cleared 4.88m at the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham. The Olympic champion went on to attempt 5.05m at the meeting on France but failed to clear that height. In the men\\'s 60m, former Olympic 100m champion Maurice Greene could only finish second to Leonard Scott. It was Greene\\'s second consecutive defeat at the hands of his fellow American, who also won in Birmingham last week. \"I ran my race perfectly,\" said Scott, who won in 6.46secs, his best time indoors. \"I am happy even if I know that Maurice is a long way from being at his peak at the start of the season.\"\\nOff-colour Gardener storms to win\\n\\nBritain\\'s Jason Gardener shook off an upset stomach to win the 60m at Sunday\\'s Leipzig International meeting.\\n\\nGardener clocked 6.56 seconds to equal the meeting record and finished well ahead of Germany\\'s Marc Blume, who crossed the line in 6.67 secs. The world indoor champion said: \"I got to the airport and my stomach was upset and I was vomiting. I almost went home. \"I felt a little better Sunday morning but decided I\\'d only run in the main race. Then everything went perfectly.\" Gardener, part of the Great Britain 4x100m quartet that won gold at the Athens Olympics, will now turn his attention to next weekend\\'s Norwich Union European Indoor trials in Sheffield.\\n\\n\"Given I am still off-colour I know there is plenty more in the tank and I expect to get faster in the next few weeks,\" he said. \"It\\'s just a case of chipping away as I have done in previous years and the results will come.\" Scotland\\'s Ian Mackie was also in action in Leipzig. He stepped down from his favoured 400m to 200m to finish third in 21.72 secs. Germany\\'s Alexander Kosenkow won the race in 21.07 secs with Dutchman Patrick van Balkom second in 21.58 secs. There were plenty of other senior British athletes showing their indoor form over the weekend. Promising 60m hurdler\\n\\nclocked a new UK record of 7.98 seconds at a meeting in Norway. The 24-year-old reached the mark in her heat but had to settle for joint first place with former AAA champion Diane Allahgreen in the final.\\n\\n, who broke onto the international scene at the Olympic Games last season, set an indoor personal best of 16.50m in the triple jump at a meeting in Ghent. That leap - 37cm short of Brazilian winner Jadel Gregorio\\'s effort - was good enough to qualify for the European Indoor Championships. At the same meeting,\\n\\nfinished third in 7.27 seconds in a high-class women\\'s 60m. The event was won by European medal favourite Christine Arron of France while Belgium rival Kim Gevaert was second. Britain\\'s Joice Maduaka finished fifth in 7.35. Olympic bronze heptathlon medallist\\n\\nmade a low-key return to action at an indoor meeting in Birmingham. The 28-year-old cleared 1.76m to win the high jump and threw 13.86m in the women\\'s shot put.\\nHolmes starts 2005 with GB events\\n\\nKelly Holmes will start 2005 with a series of races in Britain.\\n\\nHolmes will make her first track appearance on home soil since winning double Olympic gold in January\\'s Norwich Union International in Glasgow. She will also run in the Grand Prix in Birmingham in February and may defend her indoor AAA 800m title in Sheffield earlier that month. \"I am still competitive and still want to win,\" she said. \"I\\'m an athlete and I can\\'t wait to get back on the track.\" She added: \"These events are also a great opportunity to thank the British public for the enormous levels of support they have given me from the moment I stepped off that plane from Greece.\" The Glasgow meeting will see Holmes compete over 1500m in a five-way match against Sweden, France, Russia and Italy.\\nIAAF launches fight against drugs\\n\\nThe IAAF - athletics\\' world governing body - has met anti-doping officials, coaches and athletes to co-ordinate the fight against drugs in sport.\\n\\nTwo task forces have been set up to examine doping and nutrition issues. It was also agreed that a programme to \"de-mystify\" the issue to athletes, the public and the media was a priority. \"Nothing was decided to change things - it was more to have a forum of the stakeholders allowing them to express themselves,\" said an IAAF spokesman. \"Getting everyone together gave us a lot of food for thought.\" About 60 people attended Sunday\\'s meeting in Monaco, including IAAF chief Lamine Diack and Namibian athlete Frankie Fredericks, now a member of the Athletes\\' Commission. \"I am very happy to see you all, members of the athletics family, respond positively to the IAAF call to sit together and discuss what more we can do in the fight against doping,\" said Diack. \"We are the leading Federation in this field and it is our duty to keep our sport clean.\" The two task forces will report back to the IAAF Council, at its April meeting in Qatar.\\nMcIlroy continues winning streak\\n\\nJames McIlroy stormed to his second international victory in less than a week, claiming the men\\'s 800m at the TEAG indoor meeting in Erfurt.\\n\\nThe Northern Ireland runner set a new personal best of one minute, 46.68 seconds - a time good enough to qualify for the European Indoor Championships. \"I\\'m qualified now and that\\'s what matters most,\" said the 28-year-old. McIlroy is now hoping to gain a late entry into Sunday\\'s international indoor meeting in Leipzig. The Northern Irishman is hoping manager Ricky Simms can swing it for him to compete after he initially withdrew after contracting a cold. After three successive wins over the past fortnight, McIlroy is brimming with confidence. \"I\\'ve been waiting over six years for this to happen and now I\\'m certain my career has turned the corner.\" On Friday, McIlroy delivered an impressive run despite suffering from his bad cold. The AAA indoor and outdoor champion accelerated away from the field in the final 300m, beating German Wolfram Mulle by 0.90 seconds. McIlroy set a world-leading mark for 1,000m at the Sparkassen Cup in Stuttgart last weekend. And his time in Erfurt makes him third fastest over 800m in the world this year.\\nGatlin and Hayes win Owen awards\\n\\nAmerican Olympic stars Justin Gatlin and Joanna Hayes have been named the winners of the 2004 Jesse Owens Awards, USA Track & Field\\'s (USATF) top honour.\\n\\nGatlin, 22, won the closest 100m final in Games history with a career-best time of 9.85 seconds in Athens. He also won bronze in the 200m and silver in the 4x100m relay, becoming the only male athlete to win three athletics medals this summer. Hayes, 27, set an Olympic record of 12.37 in winning the 100m hurdles. Established in 1981, the Jesse Owens Awards - named in honour of the late Olympic great who won four gold medals at the 1936 Berlin Games - are presented annually to the outstanding US male and female track and field performers.\\n\\nThe 2004 awards will be presented on 3 December in conjunction with the USATF annual meeting in Portland. \"It is such a great honour to win the Jesse Owens Award,\" said Gatlin. \"It is one of the biggest honours in track and field and it is a great end to a great year. \" Hayes said: \"Knowing some of the great people who have won this award before me and knowing what it represents, I feel a sense accomplishment and pride which lets me know that everything that I have worked for is and always will be worth it.\"\\nJones medals \\'must go if guilty\\'\\n\\nWorld Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) chief Dick Pound says Marion Jones should be stripped of all her medals if found guilty of taking banned substances.\\n\\nVictor Conte, of Balco Laboratories, claims the American sprinter regularly used drugs to enhance her performance. \"If she is found guilty she should be stripped of all her medals and banned for two years,\" said Pound. Asked if there was a timescale as to what medals could be taken, Pound said: \"That is not an issue at all.\" However, under International Olympic Committee (IOC) rules, athletes can only be stripped of their medals if caught within three years of the event. Jones, who won five medals at the 2000 Olympics, denies using drugs and says she will take legal action over Conte\\'s allegations. Balco Laboratories is the firm at the centre of a wide-reaching investigation into doping in the US. Pound continued: \"If she has indeed taken drugs it is going to be a big disappointment for a lot of people.\"\\nJones files Conte lawsuit\\n\\nMarion Jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against Balco boss Victor Conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.\\n\\nThe Sydney Olympic gold medallist says Conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking $25m (£13m) in the suit. Conte, whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation, made the claims in a US television programme. He and three others were indicted in February by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences. In an email to the Associated Press on Wednesday, Conte said: \"I stand by everything I said\". Jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in Sydney in 2000. Her lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in San Francisco, said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she \"has never taken banned performance-enhancing drugs\". Conte\\'s statements, the suit added, were \"false and malicious\". After the ABC television program earlier this month, Jones\\' lawyer Richard Nicholls said: \"Marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout: she has never, ever used performance-enhancing drugs. \"Victor Conte is a man facing a 42-count federal indictment, while Marion Jones is one of America\\'s most decorated female athletes. Mr Conte\\'s statements have been wildly contradictory. \"Mr Conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television, while Marion Jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination.\\n\\n\"Mr Conte is simply not credible. We challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that Marion Jones passed.\" The sport\\'s ruling body, the IAAF, is taking a cautious approach to Conte\\'s allegations but contacted the US Anti-Doping Agency. Communications director Nick Davies said the IAAF would seek to contact Conte \"for further information\". But Davies stressed it would be up to the American authorities to decide whether they will take action against Jones in light of Conte\\'s television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely. \"If it is felt there is case to answer, it would be for its national governing body (USA Track and Field) to take the appropriate disciplinary action,\" he added. \"The US Anti-Doping Agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its anti-doping war. \"And I am sure, like ourselves, they will be watching the television programme with great interest.\" Jones, who is under investigation for steroid use by the US Anti-Doping Agency, has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the Balco scandal, although she praised a zinc supplement Conte marketed. Jones, who did not win any medals in Athens in August, has never failed a drugs test. Meanwhile, Conte, who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering, is due to face trial in March.\\nLewis-Francis turns to Christie\\n\\nMark Lewis-Francis has stepped up his preparations for the new season by taking advice from British sprint icon Linford Christie.\\n\\nThe 22-year-old is set to compete at Sheffield this weekend and will then take on Maurice Greene and Kim Collins in Birmingham on 18 February. \"Training in Wales and getting advice from Linford Christie is broadening my mind,\" said Lewis-Francis. The sprinter has also shed weight since winning relay gold at the Athens Games. \"Last year I was 91kg, now I am 86.9kg - hopefully my times will come down,\" he said. \"This has been brought about by eating the right foods and cutting out the snacks. It is just discipline and being more focused about what I am doing.\\n\\n\"I am still keeping up my weights work and I can see the improvement in my running.\" Despite playing his part in Britain\\'s successful 4x100m relay team, Lewis-Francis still feels the frustration of missing out on the individual 100m final at the 2004 Olympics. \"That was heartbreaking, but I had made it to the semi-final and for me, on a personal level, that was an achievement. \"I just have to be patient and build up for the next Olympics. That is my goal and whatever I do between now and then will be geared to making the final.\"\\nHolmes is hit by hamstring injury\\n\\nKelly Holmes has been forced out of this weekend\\'s European Indoor Athletics Championships after picking up a hamstring injury during training.\\n\\nThe double Olympic champion said: \"I am very disappointed that I have been forced to withdraw. \"I can hardly walk at the moment and I won\\'t be able to do any running for two or three weeks although I\\'ll be keeping fit as best I can.\" Holmes will have now have intensive treatment in South Africa.\\n\\nThe 34-year-old made a cautious start to the season but looked back to her best when she stormed to the 1,000m title at the Birmingham Grand Prix 10 days ago. After that race and more progress in training, Holmes revealed she had decided to compete at the European Indoors before her plans were wrecked last weekend. \"On Saturday night I pulled my hamstring running the last bend on my final 200m of the night,\" said Holmes. \"I was going really, really well when I felt a massive spasm in my left leg and my hamstring blew. \"I saw the doctor here and he has said it is not serious but it\\'s frustrating missing Madrid when I knew I was in great shape.\" Holmes has now been advised by her coach Margot Jennings not to rush back into training and it is unlikely she will compete again until the summer. Helen Clitheroe now goes to Madrid as the only British competitor in the women\\'s 1500m while there will be no representative in the 800m.\\nGreek sprinters \\'won\\'t run again\\'\\n\\nThe careers of sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou are over, says the boss of the organisation that cleared them of missing a drugs test.\\n\\nGreek Athletics Federation boss Vassilli Sevastis told the country\\'s parliament: \"I believe Kenteris and Thanou won\\'t race again. \"The damage to their commercial interests has been done,\" he added. Athletics bosses are considering its reponse to the ruling, while the athletes face a trial in a Greek court. Greek prosecutors have brought spearate charges of missing the drugs test and faking a motorcycle accident. Speaking to the Greek Parliament on Tuesday, Sevastis said that the evidence sent by the International Olympic Committee and athletics governing body the IAAF was not strong enough for the Greek Association to find the sprinters guilty.\\n\\n\"We were given the task of getting the snake out if its hole but we were not given any evidence to do it with,\" he said. \"So how can you as a Greek with your hand on your heart try the athletes?\" he added. The athletes are technically free to compete while the IAAF reviews its response to the decision to clear Kenteris and Thanou. But Sevastis said: \"It does not matter if they are found guilty at the Court of Arbitration for Sport and the current decision is reversed.\"\\nAfrican double in Edinburgh\\n\\nWorld 5000m champion Eliud Kipchoge won the 9.2km race at the View From Great Edinburgh Cross Country.\\n\\nThe Kenyan, who was second when Newcastle hosted the race last year, was in front from the outset. Ethiopian duo Gebre Gebremariam and Dejene Berhanu made last-gasp efforts to overtake him, but Kipchoge responded and a burst of speed clinched victory. Gavin Thompson was the first Briton in 12th place while Nick McCormick held of his British rivals to win the 4km race. The Morpeth Harrier led from the end of the first lap and ended Mike Skinner and Andrew Baddeley\\'s hopes with a surge in the lasp lap. \"My training has gone so well I wasn\\'t really worried about the opposition asI knew I was in great shape,\" said McCormick, who now hopes to earn a 1,500m place in the British team for the World Championships in Helsinki. In the women\\'s race, Ethiopia\\'s Tirunesh Dibaba won a battle with world cross country champion Benita Johnson to retain her title. Australian Johnson, who shocked her African rivals in Brussels last March, looked to be on course for another win in the 6.2km race. But world 5000m champion Dibaba make a telling strike for the finishing line in the final 20 metres. Britons Kathy Butler and Hayley Yelling were out of contention early on.\\nMcIlroy aiming for Madrid title\\n\\nNorthern Ireland man James McIlroy is confident he can win his first major title at this weekend\\'s Spar European Indoor Championships in Madrid.\\n\\nThe 28-year-old has been in great form in recent weeks and will go in as one of the 800 metres favourites. \"I believe after my wins abroad and in our trial race in Sheffield, I can run my race from the front, back or middle,\" said McIlroy. New coach Tony Lester has helped get McIlroy\\'s career back on track. The 28-year-old 800 metres runner has not always matched his promise with performances but believes his decision to change coaches and move base will bring the rewards. McIlroy now lives in Windsor and feels his career has been transformed by the no-nonsense leadership style of former Army sergeant Lester. Lester is better known for his work with 400m runners Roger Black and Mark Richardson in the past but under his guidance McIlroy has secured five wins this indoor season.\\n\\nMcIlroy now claims he is in his best shape since finishing fourth for Ireland at the outdoor European Championships in 1998. \"That was my last decent year,\" said McIlroy, who temporarily retired last August before returning to the sport under Lester\\'s shrewd guidance. \"Before, every race was like trying to climb Mount Everest and I now know you can\\'t do it on your own. \"Trying to succeed saw me sometimes standing half-dead and terrified on the starting line, which became a bit too much.\" McIlroy, who was compared to the likes of Sebastian Coe, Steve Cram and Steve Ovett in his younger days, is now competing without the benefit of National Lottery funding. That situation could change if he maintains his current form and repeats the world-class times he produced in the 800m and 1000m at major races in Erfurt and Stuttgart earlier this season. Russian Dmitriy Bogdanov won at the same Madrid venue last week and then claimed the European Championship race would be between himself, Dutchman Arnoud Okken and Antonio Reina of Spain but McIlroy is unfazed.\\n\\nHe admitted: \"He looked quite good in his win and fair enough everyone has the right to their own opinion. \"I never write myself off and let\\'s face it, I haven\\'t or looked like being beaten this season.\" And McIlroy, whose time of one minute 46.68seconds in Erfurt elevated him to sixth place on the UK All-Time list, is also already looking beyond Madrid. He said: \"I\\'ve been much more focused this year about my career and having such a good team around me has been very important. \"Ultimately of course, this weekend is a means to an end and that is getting prepared for the summer\\'s world championships. \"That ambition has meant that I\\'ve had only two nights out since last August. The rest of my time has seen me just concentrating on rebuilding my career.\"\\nRunning around the Olympics\\n\\nIt was back to official duties last week in my role as an ambassador to London\\'s 2012 Olympic bid. But I still managed to do all my marathon training.\\n\\nAll the sporting people on the capital\\'s bid team think I\\'m mad to be taking part in the London Marathon. The bid chairman, Lord Coe, admitted he would never dream of running a marathon, even though he was an Olympic middle-distance runner.\\n\\nKelly Holmes, former hurdler Alan Pascoe and former sprinter Frankie Fredericks - who is now an IOC member - all wanted to know why anyone would want to run that far. You\\'d have thought all these athletes, who have been running for most of their lives, wouldn\\'t think it would be that bad. But the only person who was positive about my intentions was Tanni Grey Thompson, who has won the London Marathon wheelchair race six times. Even though it was a very busy week entertaining the International Olympic Committee\\'s (IOC) Evaluation Commission, I actually found my running schedule easier to follow. When I\\'m at home, I get distracted by all sorts of things but for the five days I was in London, I was in a pressurised situation, but I found it easy to relax by running.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the presentations to the IOC team did not finish until the early evening, so I just managed to squeeze in a 45-minute run. We had an early start on Thursday because we had to visit all the Olympic sites around London, that was pretty shattering, but when we got back to the hotel, I got back on the treadmill. On Friday evening I went along to the special dinner at Buckingham Palace which was a nice occasion. I never feel guilty about eating, especially when I\\'m exercising. And because it was a rest day I didn\\'t have to feel bad about missing my training either. Anyway, I managed to do another quick run on Saturday ahead of the final IOC presentations, before heading home for my daughter\\'s birthday.\\n\\nWhen I was in London I did all of my runs on the treadmill, which isn\\'t the same as exercising outdoors. One of the IOC\\'s technical staff from Australia ran alongside me one day. We talked about the Sydney Olympics and that made the time go past more quickly. I do find it quite comfortable running in the gym because there is more cushioning. But when you\\'re gearing up to running on the road you need your body to get used to that jarring feeling when your feet hit the pavement. It was good to get out on the road for my long run on Sunday. After the week I\\'d had I was a bit concerned I wouldn\\'t be able to complete it. But I coped with it very well and, even though it was bitterly cold, I put in 15-and-a-half miles - only another 11 to go then.\\n\\n- This year Steve will donate all the proceeds from his London Marathon efforts to victims of the tsunami.Steve will be writing a regular column on the ups and downs of his marathon training for the BBC Sport website.He will be raising money through the Steve Redgrave Trust which supports the Association of Children\\'s Hospices, the Children With Leukaemia charity, and the Trust\\'s own project which aims to provide inner-city schools with rowing equipment.\\nWada will appeal against ruling\\n\\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) will appeal against the acquittal of Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou on doping charges, if the IAAF does not.\\n\\nThe pair were cleared of charges relating to missing dope tests by the Greek Athletics Federation last week. Wada chairman Dick Pound said: \"I am convinced the IAAF will appeal against the decision, and we will support them. \"But if they accept the federation\\'s ruling we will go before the Court of Arbitration for Sport,\" he added. Kenteris\\'s lawyer, Gregory Ioannidis, reacted angrily to Pound\\'s comments. \"Comments like these only help to embarrass the sporting governing bodies, create a hostage situation for the IAAF and strengthen our case further,\" he told BBC Sport. Kenteris, 31, and Thanou, 30, had been charged with avoiding drugs tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and failing to notify anti-doping officials of their whereabouts before the Olympics. They withdrew from the Athens Games after missing a drugs test at the Olympic village on 12 August.\\n\\nBut an independent tribunal ruled that the duo had not been informed that they needed to attend a drugs test in Athens.\\n\\nHowever, their former coach Christos Tzekos was banned for four years by the tribunal. Kenteris and Thanou still have to face trial on charges brought separately by Greek prosecutors of missing the drugs tests and faking a motorcycle accident to avoid testing at the Athens Games.\\nKenteris denies faking road crash\\n\\nGreek sprinter Kostas Kenteris has denied claims that he faked a motorbike crash to avoid a doping test days before the start of the Olympics.\\n\\nKenteris and fellow sprinter Katerina Thanou are set to learn if they will face criminal charges this week. Part of the investigation has centred on whether they staged the crash. Kenteris insisted: \"The accident happened. I went crazy when I found out I had supposedly missed a test and I wanted to rush to the Olympic village.\" Kenteris, speaking on Greece\\'s Alter Television station, also claimed that he asked to be tested for banned substances in hospital after the crash. \"I told the hospital, which was an Olympics-accredited hospital, to call the IOC and have me tested on the spot but no-one came.\"\\n\\nAfter a drama which dominated newspaper headlines in Greece as Athens prepared for the start of the Athens Games, Kenteris and Thanou eventually withdrew. But Kenteris has continually protested his innocence - and on Sunday blamed Greek Olympic Committee officials and his former coach Christos Tzekos for failing to inform him of the test. The 31-year-old insisted he will be happy if he is charged so he can clear his name. \"If a decision is taken to have charges filed against me, I will accept it gladly. \"A prosecution means that the case will be cleared... I want to go to the end and then we\\'ll see who\\'s right and who isn\\'t.\" Kenteris, a Greek hero after winning gold in the 200m at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, also confirmed that he was due to light the flame at the Athens opening ceremony. \"I had even rehearsed lighting the cauldron,\" he said.\\nGreene sets sights on world title\\n\\nMaurice Greene aims to wipe out the pain of losing his Olympic 100m title in Athens by winning a fourth World Championship crown this summer.\\n\\nHe had to settle for bronze in Greece behind fellow American Justin Gatlin and Francis Obikwelu of Portugal. \"It really hurts to look at that medal. It was my mistake. I lost because of the things I did,\" said Greene, who races in Birmingham on Friday. \"It\\'s never going to happen again. My goal - I\\'m going to win the worlds.\" Greene crossed the line just 0.02 seconds behind Gatlin, who won in 9.87 seconds in one of the closest and fastest sprints of all time. But Greene believes he lost the race and his title in the semi-finals. \"In my semi-final race, I should have won the race but I was conserving energy. \"That\\'s when Francis Obikwelu came up and I took third because I didn\\'t know he was there. \"I believe that\\'s what put me in lane seven in the final and, while I was in lane seven, I couldn\\'t feel anything in the race.\\n\\n\"I just felt like I was running all alone. \"I believe if I was in the middle of the race I would have been able to react to people that came ahead of me.\" Greene was also denied Olympic gold in the 4x100m men\\'s relay when he could not catch Britain\\'s Mark Lewis-Francis on the final leg. The Kansas star is set to go head-to-head with Lewis-Francis again at Friday\\'s Norwich Union Grand Prix. The pair contest the 60m, the distance over which Greene currently holds the world record of 6.39 seconds. He then has another indoor meeting in France before resuming training for the outdoor season and the task of recapturing his world title in Helsinki in August. Greene believes Gatlin will again prove the biggest threat to his ambitions in Finland. But he also admits he faces more than one rival for the world crown. \"There\\'s always someone else coming. I think when I was coming up I would say there was me and Ato (Boldon) in the young crowd,\" Greene said. \"Now you\\'ve got about five or six young guys coming up at the same time.\"\\nJohnson uncertain about Euro bid\\n\\nJade Johnson is undecided about whether to contest next month\\'s European Indoor Championships in Madrid despite winning the AAAs long jump title on Saturday.\\n\\nThe 24-year-old delivered a personal best of 6.50m to win the European trials but had to wait until her final jump after four failures. \"I don\\'t want to go if I am not going to get a medal,\" said Johnson. \"I will have to see how I am jumping in the next competition and I\\'ll have to have a conversation with my coach.\" Johnson, who finished seventh in last year\\'s Olympic Games, has not competed indoors since 2000. And the Commonwealth and European silver medallist believes her lack of experience in the early part of the season has knocked her confidence. \"It\\'s the stress,\" said Johnson. \"I am not used to feeling this, this early. I am just used to training. \"But if I\\'m doing this kind of thing, then I will have to see how it goes.\" Johnson next competes in the high-class Birmingham Grand Prix on 18 February.\\nCollins named UK Athletics chief\\n\\nUK Athletics has ended its search for a new performance director by appointing psychologist Dave Collins.\\n\\nCollins, who worked with the British teams at the 2000 and 2004 Olympics, takes over from Max Jones. Six candidates were interviewed for the job, including Denise Lewis\\' coach Charles van Commenee and former British triple jumper Keith Connor. \"We\\'ve searched long and hard to ensure we have found the right person,\" said UKA chief executive David Moorcroft. \"We have thoroughly tested the candidates. I believe David will make a great leader and I have great faith in what he will achieve.\" Collins said: \"It\\'s a great challenge. Over the next few months I will spend time listening to those who already make a significant contribution to athletics and other elite sports in the UK.\" Collins, who has worked with javelin thrower Steve Backley in the past, started his career as a Royal Marine before becoming a PE teacher. He is currently professor of physical education and sport performance at Edinburgh University, where he helps competitors across many sports, including rugby, athletics, judo and football.\\n\\nHe has specialised in helping competitors fulfil their potential through psychology and has worked with the Great Britain women\\'s curling team, who won gold at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Mark Lewis-Francis sought Collins\\' advice in Athens when he was looking for inspiration before he ran the final leg of Britain\\'s surprise triumph in the 4x100m relay. Collins has played rugby at regional level, was captain of the Great Britain American Football team, and competed at national level in judo and karate. He arrives with British athletics at a crossroads. Despite Kelly Holmes\\' golden double and the success of the sprint relay squad, the GB team failed to live up to expectations in Athens. Many older competitors have retired or are coming to the end of their careers, and Britain failed to win a single medal at the world junior championships in Italy this year. Collins will not have day-to-day coaching contact with the athletes, but will be expected to make changes to the system and coaching set-up in order to secure medals at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. The appointment of a new performance director was one of the main recommendations in Sir Andrew Foster\\'s review of the sport, which was published in May. It was commissioned by UK Sport and Sport England, which wanted UK Athletics to justify funding of more than £40m from the Government following the failure to hang on to the 2005 World Championships, which are now being held in Helsinki. Van Commenee dropped out of the selection process to take on the same role with the Dutch Olympic Committee, while Connor\\'s application was rejected after an arduous interview process. Foster, however, declared himself satisfied with how the appointment was made. \"The appointment of David Collins, with his strong mix of leadership skills and managerial experience, is testament to the professional and detailed recruitment process,\" he said.\\nRadcliffe yet to answer GB call\\n\\nPaula Radcliffe has been granted extra time to decide whether to compete in the World Cross-Country Championships.\\n\\nThe 31-year-old is concerned the event, which starts on 19 March in France, could upset her preparations for the London Marathon on 17 April. \"There is no question that Paula would be a huge asset to the GB team,\" said Zara Hyde Peters of UK Athletics. \"But she is working out whether she can accommodate the worlds without too much compromise in her marathon training.\" Radcliffe must make a decision by Tuesday - the deadline for team nominations. British team member Hayley Yelling said the team would understand if Radcliffe opted out of the event. \"It would be fantastic to have Paula in the team,\" said the European cross-country champion. \"But you have to remember that athletics is basically an individual sport and anything achieved for the team is a bonus. \"She is not messing us around. We all understand the problem.\" Radcliffe was world cross-country champion in 2001 and 2002 but missed last year\\'s event because of injury. In her absence, the GB team won bronze in Brussels.\\nHolmes back on form in Birmingham\\n\\nDouble Olympic champion Kelly Holmes was back to her best as she comfortably won the 1,000m at the Norwich Union Birmingham Indoor Grand Prix.\\n\\nThe 34-year-old, running only her second competitive race of the season, shook off the rust to win in two minutes, 35.39 seconds. But she is still undecided about competing in the European Championships in Madrid from 4-6 March. \"I\\'ll probably be entered and make my mind up at the last minute,\" she said. \"My training hasn\\'t gone as well as expected but I\\'ve got two weeks to decide. \"I need to take my time and make sure I feel good about what I\\'m doing. \"I felt very good here but with the crowd behind you, you feel like you can do anything.\" American\\n\\nwas the eventual winner of the men\\'s 60m race which almost ended in farce. Three athletes were disqualified for false starting, including Britain\\'s Mark Lewis-Francis, who was the first man guilty of coming out of his blocks too quickly. World 100m champion Kim Collins clinched second spot ahead of world 60m record holder and Scott\\'s training partner Maurice Greene. Jason Gardener\\'s unbeaten run came to an end as he came fifth and he will need to improve if he is to defend his European title in Madrid. \"You can\\'t win them all,\" said Gardener afterwards. \"And I was very disappointed as I know I\\'m capable of doing better.\" Russian\\n\\nwas back on record-breaking form in the pole vault at the National Indoor Arena.\\n\\nThe Olympic champion set a new world mark of 4.88m to break her own record - which she set just six days ago - and beat Russian rival Svetlana Feofanova. It was Isinbayeva\\'s 11th world record - indoors or out - since July 2003. \"I\\'m so happy and I will do my best to break the 5m barrier soon,\" the 22-year-old told BBC Sport. Jamaica\\'s\\n\\nstormed to a personal best of 7.13 seconds to claim the women\\'s 60m sprint. Belgian Kim Gevaert, who will be one of the favourites for next month\\'s European title, took second while American Muna Lee was third. There was disappointment for British pair Jeanette Kwakye and Joice Maduaka who finished seventh and eighth respectively.\\n\\nJamaican\\n\\nstretched her unbeaten record to 25 races as she effortlessly claimed the 200m. The Olympic champion set a new indoor personal best of 22.38 seconds - the fastest time in the world this season.\\n\\nfought off fellow Briton Tim Abeyie to take the men\\'s 200m in a personal best of 20.88.\\n\\ncontinued her outstanding start to the season, beating a strong international field, which included two-time Olympic 100m hurdles bronze medallist Melissa Morrison, to claim the women\\'s 60m hurdles. The 25-year-old Briton clocked 7.98 seconds while pre-European Championships favourite Russian Irina Shevchenko finished down in sixth. Ethiopia\\'s\\n\\nfailed in her bid to smash compatriot Berhane Adere\\'s world 3,000m record but still won the event in emphatic style. The Olympic 5,000m champion was inside record pace but dropped off over the final third, finishing in eight minutes, 33.05 seconds - the fourth fastest time ever recorded for the event. Britain\\'s Jo Pavey bravely decided to go with Defar as she strode away from the field and took second in a season\\'s best 8:41.43. Kenyan\\n\\nalso missed out on the indoor 1500m world record, which Hicham El Guerrouj has held for the last eight years.\\n\\nLagat settled for silver behind El Guerrouj in Athens and was almost four seconds short of the Moroccan\\'s world best, clocking 3:35.27 in Birmingham. And\\n\\nwas still struggling to find his form after the death of his fiancee this year. The Olympic 10,000m champion had comfortably led the men\\'s two mile race after his younger brother Tariku had set the pace. But fellow Ethiopian\\n\\nappeared ominously on Bekele\\'s shoulder with two laps to go before surging past him at the bell to win in 8:14.28. Jamaican\\n\\nmade the most of a blistering start to take the men\\'s 400m title in 45.91 seconds. World indoor champion, Alleyne Francique, faded badly and finished in fourth while American duo Jerry Harris and James Davis took second and third respectively. Swede\\n\\nshowed her class in the long jump as she stole top spot from Jade Johnson with the very last jump of the competition. The Olympic heptathlon gold medallist reached 6.66m to better Johnson\\'s mark of 6.52m - her second personal best inside a week. \"I was quite surprised because I didn\\'t think I\\'d end up with second place,\" said Johnson, who wore London\\'s 2012 Olympic bid slogan, \"Back the Bid\", on her shorts. \"But I\\'m pleased and hopefully I\\'ll get a bit better for the Europeans. I really want to win a medal.\"\\n\\nwon the men\\'s event with a season\\'s best of 7.95m, taking the scalp of world indoor champion Savante Stringfellow of the USA.\\nHolmes facing fine over trials\\n\\nDouble Olympic champion Kelly Holmes faces a fine of around £25,000 after opting to miss this weekend\\'s trials for the European championship.\\n\\nRules brought in last year state athletes who miss trials without proof of injury or illness will forfeit a quarter of the fee for that season. A spokesman for Fast Track, the sport\\'s promoters in Britain, told the Times that Holmes would be no exception. The paper said she was set to earn £100,000 for the domestic indoor term. Holmes, who won both 800m and 1500m gold in Athens, opened her British indoor campaign by winning the 1500m at the Norwich Union International in Glasgow last month. She is also set to race at the Grand Prix in Birmingham on 18 February. But governing body UK Athletics (UKA) said the trials in Sheffield were never in her plans. \"It was always Kelly\\'s plan for the indoor season to prioritise only two UK televised meetings at Glasgow and Birmingham,\" a UKA statement said.\\n\\n\"She never intended to compete at the European Indoor Trials. UK Athletics can confirm Kelly Holmes will not compete in Sheffield.\" But a Fast Track spokesman said: \"Kelly will be fined 25% of her indoor earnings. \"It is a policy that applies to all GB athletes and Kelly accepts that. \"During the course of contract talks, which resulted in Kelly taking part in Glasgow and Birmingham, it was explained what would happen if she did not participate in the trials.\" Holmes has always said she will not decide whether to compete at the European Indoor Championships in Madrid in March until after Birmingham. But should she wish to, it is unlikely to be a problem despite her decision to miss the trials. Under UKA selection criteria, selectors can pick athletes who did not compete in trials on the basis of \"exceptional circumstances\".\\nGB select Holmes for double bid\\n\\nKelly Holmes has been chosen for both the 800m and 1500m at next month\\'s European Indoor Championships - despite not yet confirming her availability.\\n\\nThe double-Olympic champion is still undecided about whether to compete in her first European Indoors in Madrid. But UK Athletics chief Max Jones believes it is likely Holmes will race. He said: \"It\\'s worth a punt, isn\\'t it? She\\'s gone back to training. If she\\'s confident she will pick one (distance). The programme does not permit both.\" If Holmes does take her place in the GB side, she has already indicated that 1500m will be her favoured distance. Under championship rules, she does not have to decide until 24 hours before the event begins in Madrid on 4 March. Jones added: \"She was pleased with her run in Birmingham (at last weekend\\'s Grand Prix). \"I am inclined to think she will (compete). It could depend on how training goes and she will have to be close to top form.\" And he admitted Holmes\\' presence would be a great boost to the rest of the Norwich Union GB team. \"She is a very good team member and is very good to have there,\" he added. Meanwhile, there is no surprises in the rest of the Great Britain team announced on Tuesday.\\n\\nDefending 60m champion Jason Gardener is included and will be chasing his third successive gold medal. He will be joined in the event by Mark Lewis-Francis - runner-up behind him three years ago in Vienna - and new boy Darren Chin. Kelly Sotherton has been invited by championship organisers to compete against Carolina Kluft in the pentathlon. Sotherton finished third in the Olympic heptathlon in Athens, where the Swede took gold. There are 16 newcomers at this level of competition in GB\\'s 46-strong team. The championships will be the last to be attended by Jones before he retires to be succeeded by Dave Collins. Jones said: \"The Olympic Games is the overwhelming target for UKA and therefore it is beneficial to start the next four-year cycle with a not-so-pressurised major games. \"The European Indoor Championships always provide a chance for the young and inexperienced to make a name for themselves and the current indoor season has produced some exciting new talent. \"Madrid is the first small step on a long journey to Beijing and the 2008 Olympics but for some of the emerging athletes, this will be a very important step.\"\\n\\n60m: D Chin (Belgrave Harriers), J Gardener (Wessex and Bath), M Lewis-Francis (Birchfield Harriers).\\n\\nT Abeyie (Woodford Green with Essex Ladies), C Lambert (Belgrave Harriers).\\n\\nD Garland (Channel Islands AC).\\n\\nJ McIlroy (Windsor, Slough, Eton and Hounslow AC), Jimmy Watkins (Cardiff AAC).\\n\\nEd Jackson (Aldershot, Farnham and District), N Speaight (Belgrave Harriers), J Thie (Cardiff AAC).\\n\\nA Baddeley (Harrow AC), M Farah (Windsor, Slough, Eton and Hounslow AC), J Mayock (Barnsley AC).\\n\\nD Greaves (Newham and Essex Beagles), A Scott (Shaftesbury Barnet Harriers), A Turner (Notts AC).\\n\\nB Challenger (Belgrave Harriers).

The British sprint quartet produced a string of faultless baton changes in the final to put pressure on the Americans.\\n\\nAnd when the USA stumbled with a poor switch between Justin Gatlin and Coby Miller at the 300m stage, Britain edged ahead going into the final bend. Then, on cue, Lewis-Francis ran a textbook final leg, holding off Maurice Greene to bring Team GB home in 38.07 seconds - just one hundredth of a second ahead of their rivals. \"Winning the gold medal was the highlight of my athletics career so far,\" said the Birchfield Harrier. \"This award is not just for me, but for all my friends, family and the people who have helped me to get to this level in my sport.\" Gardener added: \"All of us had worked very hard for a long, long time to carry off what most believed was an impossible task. \"Of course this award is very special, but for me nothing will ever take away winning an Olympic gold medal. It\\'s all I ever wanted. \"All my life that is what I dreamed of doing. Life since then has been fantastic.\" Campbell agreed receiving the honour capped off what has been a difficult year for the sprinter. \"I think the MBE is important because the people closest to me know my journey,\" said the Newport-based athlete. \"I\\'ve not just stumbled upon this. \"It gives me a lot of joy and satisfaction to know the stuff you do for your country does mean something.\"\\n\\n- There was also recognition for James Clarke, chairman of the London Marathon. He becomes an OBE.\\nRadcliffe will compete in London\\n\\nPaula Radcliffe will compete in the Flora London Marathon this year after deciding her schedule for 2005.\\n\\nThe 31-year-old won the race in 2002 on her marathon debut, defended her title 12 months later and will now seek a third title in the 17 April race. \"It doesn\\'t get any better than this for the 25th anniversary,\" said race director David Bedford. \"After announcing the greatest men\\'s field ever we now have the greatest women\\'s distance runner ever.\" Three years ago Radcliffe smashed the women\\'s world record in two hours 18 minutes 15 seconds.\\n\\nThe Bedford star returned to London 12 months later, lowering her mixed-race world record of 2:17:18, which she set in Chicago in October 2003, by one minute 53 secs. Radcliffe\\'s career took a setback when she failed to complete the Olympic marathon and later dropped out of the Athens 10,000m last August. But the 31-year-old bounced back to win the New York Marathon in November. Radcliffe, however, passed up the chance to go for the \"Big City\" marathon grand slam. With wins in Chicago, London and New York, only the Boston Marathon remains to be conquered but that takes place a day after London. \"Boston is definitely a race I want to do at some point, but London is very special to me,\" said Radcliffe. \"I don\\'t pick races thinking about things like pressure. I pick the ones in my heart I really want to do. \"I love the atmosphere, crowds and course and know it will always be a great quality race. \"It is also the 25th anniversary this year which adds to the occasion.\"\\nMerritt close to indoor 400m mark\\n\\nTeenager LaShawn Merritt ran the third fastest indoor 400m of all time at the Fayetteville Invitational meeting.\\n\\nThe world junior champion clocked 44.93 seconds to finish well clear of fellow American Bershawn Jackson in Arkansas. Only Michael Johnson has gone quicker, setting the world record of 44.63secs in 1995 and running 44.66secs in 1996. Kenyan Bernard Lagat missed out on the world record by 1.45secs as he ran the third quickest indoor mile ever to beat Canada\\'s Nate Brannen by almost 10secs. The Olympic silver medallist\\'s time of three minutes 49.89secs was inferior only to the 1997 world record of Moroccan Hicham El Guerrouj and former world record holder Eamonn Coghlan of Ireland\\'s 3:49.78. Lagat was on course to break El Guerrouj\\'s record through 1200m but could not maintain the pace over the final 400m. Ireland\\'s\\n\\ncontinued his excellent form by winning a tight 3,000m in 7:40.53. Cragg, who recently defeated Olympic 10,000m champion Kenenisa Bekele in Boston, held off Bekele\\'s Ethiopian colleague Markos Geneti by only 0.19secs to secure his victory. Mark Carroll, who will join Cragg in the European Indoor Championships next month, finished a solid third in 7:46.78. Olympic 200m gold medallist\\n\\nof Jamaica ran the fastest women\\'s 60m in the world this year as she equalled her personal best of 7.09secs. World indoor 60m hurdles champion\\n\\nalso won, improving his season-leading time to 7.51secs.\\nAthens memories soar above lows\\n\\nWell, it\\'s goodbye to another Olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in Athens.\\n\\nObviously, there\\'s no getting away from the differing fortunes of Kelly Holmes and Paula Radcliffe. But I want to remind you of a few more events that made 2004 another year to remember - or forget - for athletics. \\n\\n \\n\\nOne of my favourite Olympic moments was Kelly\\'s success in the 800m.\\n\\nWinning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality. Kelly had been full of \"should I, shouldn\\'t I?\" thoughts about going for the double in Athens. I thought why wouldn\\'t you do the 800m, it\\'s your best event? It was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her Athens story. \\n\\n \\n\\nThe victory for the British men\\'s 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the Games. I think the four of them - Jason Gardener, Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis - knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal. The lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake. \\n\\n \\n\\nHicham El Guerrouj\\'s Olympic double is a much bigger achievement than Kelly\\'s on a global scale.\\n\\nHe was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5,000m titles. As soon as he had added the 5,000m crown and I had finished commentating, I jumped up, ran down the stairs, pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug. He is one of the few African runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the Roger Bannister stories. Hicham is someone I enjoy having a bit of time with, even though my French and his English are not very good. \\n\\n \\n\\nWhat happened to Paula in Athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well. There were a set of circumstances around Athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which I think has been greatly misunderstood. Dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10,000m five days later was not wise. That was her heart and not her head reacting. Paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day.\\n\\nThings like niggling injuries, not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her. I think she came to the start line in Athens physically and emotionally drained. And if even the smallest thing doesn\\'t feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon, 10 miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall. The positive thing to take from Paula\\'s Olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people - including me. \\n\\n \\n\\nPurely as a race, Paula\\'s victory in the New York Marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling. It was so nip-and-tuck between her and Kenya\\'s Susan Chepkemei and you don\\'t usually get that kind of excitement in marathons. It was also a real delight for all athletics fans because, to use one of my favourite words, Paula showed real \"bouncebackability\". And it was a bit of a rarity for me too because I genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out. \\n\\n \\n\\nKelly and the 4x100m boys\\' victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the British team. We should be concerned that we\\'re not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level.\\n\\nThe only individual men\\'s finalist on the track was Michael East in the 1500m. I am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed? And that\\'s where things begin to look even gloomier for British athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in Italy. Dani Barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for Team GB. The thing is if we don\\'t have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesn\\'t look good for the Beijing Olympics and beyond. \\n\\n \\n\\nI tell you what I really enjoyed this year, Benita Johnson winning the world cross country championships back in March. In the absence of Paula, we tend to think of the event as something of an African preserve. So to have an Australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special. \\n\\n \\n\\nTo be honest, I\\'m getting bored with all the drug scandals, especially Balco. I just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on.\\n\\nHaving said that, I\\'m always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore. And one of the positive things to come out of Balco is people are starting to blow the whistle. We need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats. As regards the case against Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou, well suspicions have been hanging over Kenteris for a while. The bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it.\\nGreek pair set for hearing\\n\\nKostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou will fight the provisional two-year bans imposed on them by the IAAF at an independent tribunal this weekend.\\n\\nAthletics\\' ruling body took action against the pair for failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics. An independent tribunal of the Greek Track and Field Federation will meet to decide whether to ratify the sanction. The sprint duo face charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to a drugs test. Kenteris\\' lawyer Gregory Ioannidis told BBC Sport: \"We refute both charges as unsubstantiated and illogical. \"There have been certain breaches in the correct application of the rules on behalf of the sporting authorities and their officials, and these procedural breaches have also violated my client\\'s rights. \"There is also evidence that proves the fact that my client has been persecuted.\" Ioannidis, who is a law lecturer at the University of Buckingham, added: \"One of the important rights and foundations of law and justice - that the accused should be presumed innocent unless proved otherwise - has been tarnished.\" The panel will also decide on the two-year ban imposed on the athletes\\' controversial coach Christos Tzekos by the IAAF. Kenteris, the 2000 Olympic 200m champion, and Thanou, the women\\'s 100m silver medallist from the same Games in Sydney, quit the Olympics on 18 August after failing to give samples on the eve of the opening ceremony.\\n\\nTesters could not find them at the Olympic village and the duo were later admitted to hospital after claiming to have been involved in a motorcycle accident. They also missed tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens before the Games. In imposing two-year suspensions on the duo on 22 December, the IAAF described their explanations for missing the tests as \"unacceptable\". Whatever the findings of the independent tribunal, all parties will have the right to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The tribunal hearing will take place at the Hellenic Olympic Committee building. It will start at 1200 GMT on Saturday and is expected to finish early next week. The tribunal panel will consist of five members - president Konstantinos Panagopoulos and Panagiotis Dimakos, Haralabos Hrisanthakis, Stilianos Perakis and Ioannis Karmis. Kenteris and Thanou also face criminal charges in Greece for allegedly faking the motorcycle accident. Eight criminal charges have been laid against the sprinters as well as Tzekos, an eyewitness to the accident and hospital officials. But there has been speculation that the charges could be dropped.\\nJohnson accuses British sprinters\\n\\nFormer Olympic champion Michael Johnson has accused Britain\\'s top sprinters of lacking pride and ambition.\\n\\n\"At the moment, the biggest factor on the mind of British sprinters is to be number one in Britain,\" the world 200m and 400m record holder told Five Live. \"Athletics at the moment is all about international competitions and they need to show a little more pride.\" However, Linford Christie countered: \"It\\'s easy to criticise when you haven\\'t gone through the system here.\" Johnson was involved in a verbal spat with Britain\\'s Darren Campbell earlier this year. The American had cast doubt on Campbell\\'s claims he had torn a hamstring in the wake of his failure to reach the Olympic 100m and 200m finals.\\n\\nAnd the American remains highly critical of aspects of British sprinting. \"The only time you see British sprinters getting upset or riled is when there is a debate as to which one is better than the other,\" he claimed. \"Athletes here have to compete more outside the UK. Their focus has to be on being the best in the world and not just on being the top British sprinter.\" Speaking at an elite coaches\\' conference in Birmingham, Johnson also argued that although there has been more investment in the sport in Britain, it had not necessarily reaped the rewards. \"You can\\'t fix everything with money,\" he admitted. \"You contrast the situation here to that of some US athletes who have no funding. \"Those who aren\\'t funded might be hungrier and more motivated because their road to success is a lot more difficult and challenging. \"So when they get to the top they are more appreciative.\"\\nCollins appeals against drugs ban\\n\\nSprinter Michelle Collins has lodged an appeal against her eight-year doping ban with the North American Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).\\n\\nThe 33-year-old received the ban last month as a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the Balco doping scandal. She is the first athlete to be banned without a positive drugs test or an admission of drugs use. CAS has said that a ruling is normally given within four months of an appeal. Collins was suspended by the US Anti-Doping Agency based on patterns observed in her blood and urine tests as well as evidence in the Balco investigation. As well as being hit with the ban, Collins was stripped of her 2003 world and US indoor 200m titles. The San Francisco-based Balco laboratory is at the centre of the scandal which has rocked the sport. The company has been accused of distributing illegal performance-enhancing drugs to elite athletes.\\nButler strikes gold in Spain\\n\\nBritain\\'s Kathy Butler continued her impressive year with victory in Sunday\\'s 25th Cross Internacional de Venta de Banos in Spain.\\n\\nThe Scot, who led GB to World Cross Country bronze earlier this year, moved away from the field with Ines Monteiro halfway into the 6.6km race. She then shrugged off her Portuguese rival to win in 20 minutes 38 seconds. Meanwhile, Briton Karl Keska battled bravely to finish seventh in the men\\'s 10.6km race in a time of 31:41. Kenenisa Bekele of Ethiopia - the reigning world long and short course champion - was never troubled by any of the opposition, winning leisurely in 30.26. Butler said of her success: \"I felt great throughout the race and hope this is a good beginning for a marvellous 2005 season for me.\" Elsewhere, Abebe Dinkessa of Ethiopia won the Brussels IAAF cross-country race on Sunday, completing the 10,500m course in 33.22. Gelete Burka then crowned a great day for Ethiopia by claiming victory in the women\\'s race.\\nO\\'Sullivan could run in Worlds\\n\\nSonia O\\'Sullivan has indicated that she would like to participate in next month\\'s World Cross Country Championships in St Etienne.\\n\\nAthletics Ireland have hinted that the 35-year-old Cobh runner may be included in the official line-up for the event in France on 19-20 March. Provincial teams were selected after last Saturday\\'s Nationals in Santry and will be officially announced this week. O\\'Sullivan is at present preparing for the London marathon on 17 April. The participation of O\\'Sullivan, currentily training at her base in Australia, would boost the Ireland team who won the bronze three years agio. The first three at Santry last Saturday, Jolene Byrne, Maria McCambridge and Fionnualla Britton, are automatic selections and will most likely form part of the long-course team. O\\'Sullivan will also take part in the Bupa Great Ireland Run on 9 April in Dublin.\\nBekele sets sights on world mark\\n\\nOlympic 10,000m champion Kenenisa Bekele is determined to add the world indoor two mile record at February\\'s Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham.\\n\\nThe 22-year-old will again be chasing a record held by his compatriot and mentor Haile Gebrselassie, who set the mark at the same meeting in 2003. \"I am still as hungry to do as much as I can in this sport,\" said Bekele. \"And aiming for the two mile world record in Birmingham is the next of those targets.\" Gebrselassie\\'s current record stands at eight minutes, 04.69 seconds. And Bekele is no stranger to overhauling world marks at the National Indoor Arena. The Ethiopian broke the world indoor 5,000m record on his debut at the meeting last year. Compatriots Mulugeta Wondimu, Abiyote Abate and Markos Geneti, the world indoor bronze medallist over 3000m, will race against Bekele on 18 February. The meet has already attracted a crop of Olympic talent. Britain\\'s 800m and 1500m champion Kelly Holmes is taking part in the 1000m. Swedish heptathlon gold medallist Carolina Kluft will contest the 60m hurdles. While men\\'s 4x100m relay gold medallists Jason Gardener and Mark Lewis-Francis will go head-to-head in the 60m.\\nLewis-Francis shakes off injury\\n\\nSprinter Mark Lewis-Francis is determined to get his indoor campaign back on track after a hamstring problem affected his season opener on Saturday.\\n\\nThe Olympic relay gold medallist pulled out of the 60m final with bad cramp at the Birmingham Games. \"I hope to be fully fit for the European Indoor Trials at the end of next week,\" said Lewis-Francis. \"I\\'m back jogging and with more treatment I will be able to resume full training in the next couple of days.\" The 22-year-old goes head-to-head with relay team-mate Jason Gardener for a place in Great Britain\\'s European Championships squad at the trials in Sheffield.\\n\\nThen Lewis-Francis is set for a re-match with American Maurice Greene, who he edged out in the Olympic 4x100m final, at the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham on 18 February. And the Birchfield Harrier is confident he can replicate his form on the boards. \"I\\'m really looking forward to competing against Jason and Maurice,\" added Lewis-Francis. \"My winter training has gone very well and I want to improve my 60m personal best in the next few weeks.\"\\nClaxton hunting first major medal\\n\\nBritish hurdler Sarah Claxton is confident she can win her first major medal at next month\\'s European Indoor Championships in Madrid.\\n\\nThe 25-year-old has already smashed the British record over 60m hurdles twice this season, setting a new mark of 7.96 seconds to win the AAAs title. \"I am quite confident,\" said Claxton. \"But I take each race as it comes. \"As long as I keep up my training but not do too much I think there is a chance of a medal.\" Claxton has won the national 60m hurdles title for the past three years but has struggled to translate her domestic success to the international stage. Now, the Scotland-born athlete owns the equal fifth-fastest time in the world this year. And at last week\\'s Birmingham Grand Prix, Claxton left European medal favourite Russian Irina Shevchenko trailing in sixth spot.\\n\\nFor the first time, Claxton has only been preparing for a campaign over the hurdles - which could explain her leap in form. In previous seasons, the 25-year-old also contested the long jump but since moving from Colchester to London she has re-focused her attentions. Claxton will see if her new training regime pays dividends at the European Indoors which take place on 5-6 March.\\nYelling takes Cardiff hat-trick\\n\\nEuropean cross-country champion Hayley Yelling completed a hat-trick of wins in the Reebok Cardiff Cross Challenge in Bute Park on Sunday afternoon.\\n\\nThe part-time maths teacher beat Irish international Jolene Byrne by 40 metres in the six-kilometre race. Another Great Britain international, Louise Damen, finished third as part of the contingent representing England. Peter Riley, who secured bronze for the GB men\\'s team at last month\\'s European Championships, won the men\\'s 9km race. Riley, representing England, moved away over the last two kilometres to win by 25 metres from Ireland\\'s Gary Murray. Glynn Tromans - the reigning UK Inter-Countries and England Cross-Country champion - came in third place as he continues his comeback from a five-month injury lay-off.\\nPavey focuses on indoor success\\n\\nJo Pavey will miss January\\'s View From Great Edinburgh International Cross Country to focus on preparing for the European Indoor Championships in March.\\n\\nThe 31-year-old was third behind Hayley Yelling and Justyna Bak in last week\\'s European Cross Country Championships but she prefers to race on the track. \"It was great winning bronze but I\\'m wary of injuries and must concentrate on the indoor season,\" she said. \"Because of previous injuries I don\\'t even run up hills in training.\" Pavey, who came fifth in the 5,000m at the Athens Olympics, helped the British cross country team win the team silver medal in Heringsdorf last week. She is likely to start her 3,000m season with a race in either Boston or Stuttgart at the end of January.\\nJones files lawsuit against Conte\\n\\nMarion Jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against Balco boss Victor Conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.\\n\\nThe Sydney Olympic gold medallist says Conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking $25m (£13m) in the suit. Conte, whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation, made the claims in a US television programme. He and three others were indicted in February by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences. In an email to the Associated Press on Wednesday, Conte said: \"I stand by everything I said\". Jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in Sydney in 2000. Her lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in San Francisco, said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she \"has never taken banned performance-enhancing drugs\". Conte\\'s statements, the suit added, were \"false and malicious\". After the ABC television program earlier this month, Jones\\' lawyer Richard Nicholls said: \"Marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout: she has never, ever used performance-enhancing drugs. \"Victor Conte is a man facing a 42-count federal indictment, while Marion Jones is one of America\\'s most decorated female athletes. Mr Conte\\'s statements have been wildly contradictory. \"Mr Conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television, while Marion Jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination.\\n\\n\"Mr Conte is simply not credible. We challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that Marion Jones passed.\" The sport\\'s ruling body, the IAAF, is taking a cautious approach to Conte\\'s allegations but contacted the US Anti-Doping Agency. Communications director Nick Davies said the IAAF would seek to contact Conte \"for further information\". But Davies stressed it would be up to the American authorities to decide whether they will take action against Jones in light of Conte\\'s television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely. \"If it is felt there is case to answer, it would be for its national governing body (USA Track and Field) to take the appropriate disciplinary action,\" he added. \"The US Anti-Doping Agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its anti-doping war. \"And I am sure, like ourselves, they will be watching the television programme with great interest.\" Jones, who is under investigation for steroid use by the US Anti-Doping Agency, has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the Balco scandal, although she praised a zinc supplement Conte marketed. Jones, who did not win any medals in Athens in August, has never failed a drugs test. Meanwhile, Conte, who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering, is due to face trial in March.\\nRadcliffe eyes hard line on drugs\\n\\nPaula Radcliffe has called for all athletes found guilty on drugs charges to be treated as criminals.\\n\\nThe marathon world record holder believes more needs to be done to rid athletics of the \"suspicions and innuendoes\" which greet any fast time. \"Doping in sport is a criminal offence and should be treated as such,\" the 30-year-old told the Sunday Times. \"It not only cheats other athletes but also cheats promoters, sponsors and the general public.\"\\n\\nRadcliffe\\'s comments come at a time when several American sports stars are under suspicion of steroid use. \"Being caught in possession of a performance-enhancing drugs should carry a penalty,\" she added.\\n\\n\"The current system does not detect many of the substances being abused by athletes. \"This means that often athletes do not know if they are competing on a level playing field, if their hard work and sacrifice is being trumped by an easier scientific route. \"Often, when an athlete puts in a good performance, they are subjected to suspicions and innuendoes instead of praise. \"Having been on the receiving end of accusations like this I can testify as to how much this hurts.\"\\nWhat now for Kelly Holmes?\\n\\nLast April, Kelly Holmes spoke to the BBC Sport website about her loneliness, her fight to stay fit and her decision not to contest both the 800m and 1500m at the Olympics.\\n\\nIt just goes to show even the most meticulous and measured athletes cannot predict what fate has in store for them. Four months later, Holmes stormed to double Olympic gold and has since been made a Dame, won the BBC Sport Personality of the Year and written a book whilst still finding time to coach aspiring athletes. With so much time spent in the spotlight, Holmes has increasingly dropped hints that her ambition on the track has begun to wilt. And when asked about her plans for both the indoor and outdoor seasons ahead, the 34-year-old has repeatedly chosen to tick the \"don\\'t know\" box. Holmes has now pulled out of this weekend\\'s European Indoor Championships, where she was selected for both the 800m and 1500m, because of a hamstring injury. But should we be surprised if the Olympic champion over both those distances decides she just does not feel like racing anymore? \"Well, it\\'s a lot easier being the double Olympic champion, being feted by everybody, than training to be at the top in middle distance running,\" points out former Olympian and BBC pundit Steve Cram. \"You have to have a real strong desire to carry on doing it even if you\\'re very talented.\"\\n\\nHolmes\\' drive and determination have always been unquestionable - that is the reason she has battled back from a string of injuries that threatened to see her finish her career empty-handed. But alarm bells start ringing when the Kent athlete begins questioning herself. \"Will I have as much commitment, desire and energy to go through a major championship?\" Holmes asked in the New Year. \"That is what I don\\'t know.\" At 34, Holmes will also be aware that time is running out. US 400m and 200m legend Michael Johnson, a five-time Olympic gold medallist, retired shortly after his 34th birthday as did Britain\\'s double Olympic champion decathlete Daley Thompson. The physical demands of the day-to-day grind will only get harder for Holmes, who has already admitted she \"doesn\\'t like the training anymore.\" Whilst out on the circuit the allure of defeating a double Olympic champion will spur her opponents on. Holmes will not want to needlessly suffer the indignity of being beaten. Unless she is certain she has a strong chance of winning any race, she will not step onto the track. But if the Kent athlete finds the form that fuelled her ambitions last summer, there are more prizes up for grabs. The day after completing her double in Athens, the 34-year-old revealed she would still like to win her first indoors title.\\n\\nHolmes\\' wish could easily be met in Madrid before she goes on to prepare for the outdoor season where there are still scores to be settled, such as a first gold at the World Championships in Helsinki. There is just one small truth which could gnaw away at Holmes\\' motivation - the realisation that no matter how hard she trains, nothing she wins now can surpass her achievements in Athens. On the other hand, if those achievements cannot be matched shouldn\\'t they be at least shared and celebrated? \"You don\\'t get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double Olympic champion,\" agreed Cram. \"You want to be able to take your bow in front of the fans because it\\'s a fantastic feeling. \"I think deep down Kelly wants to run. I think she will compete and run races on the circuits but whether or not she runs in the major championships is much less certain.\"\\n\\nAthletics fans had every reason to believe they would see the new-look Kelly Holmes tearing up the track again. After her Olympic glory she emphatically denied she planned to retire. So, why is Holmes dragging her heels about making a decision on where, when or whether to even bother competing again? \"That\\'s just Kelly,\" explains Cram. \"She\\'s always been like that. \"She enjoys people trying to guess what she is going to do next. She knows every time she makes a pronouncement now it\\'s headline news. \"Kelly has to figure out for herself what it is she wants and that will be based on athletics decisions, whether she can be competitive, if she is fit enough to put her neck on the line. \"And if she decides not to run again, no-one is going to turn round and say \\'you\\'re making the wrong decision.\\'\"\\nPittman drops coach for UK base\\n\\nAustralia\\'s world 400m hurdle champion Jana Pittman has split from coach Phil King and is now training with her British fiance Chris Rawlinson.\\n\\n\"The opportunity to live and train in Europe is something Jana has always courted,\" King said. \"I have enjoy working with her and wish her well.\" Pittman is working with Rawlinson\\'s coach Nick Dakin at Loughborough, but he denied he was her new coach. \"I\\'m helping her but don\\'t know if that will continue,\" Dakin told BBC Sport. Rawlinson and Pittman met at last summer\\'s Olympic Games and got engaged in November. Pittman has been working alongside Rawlinson in Dakin\\'s group of elite athletes that includes 400m runner Iwan Thomas and Jamaican hurdler Kemel Thompson. But Dakin told BBC Sport that the arrangement is by no means permanent. \"Jana is doing a mixture of methods that have worked for her in the past and some of the sessions I\\'m setting for Chris,\" Dakin explained. \"She is going back to Australia in early February but I\\'m not sure how long that\\'s for. She might come back on our warm weather programme around Easter, but that will be up to her.\\n\\n\"She\\'s an incredibly strong trainer and she is getting the benefit of a having a group of people to chase and to motivate her.\" Pittman finished in fifth place in her Olympic final while Rawlinson failed to get beyond the semi-finals after hitting his first hurdle. The Rotherham athlete\\'s build-up to the Games had been affected by a stomach upset. And Dakin believes the couple\\'s relationship both on and off the track will make them stronger for the season ahead. \"I think it\\'s positive for them both,\" said Dakin. \"They\\'re both world-class athletes who have an understanding of what it takes and who understand the pitfalls. \"Their relationship is a good source of reassurance and advice for both of them. \"Jana is continuing to focus on defending her world title in Helsinki while Chris is planning to go through to the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, where he is defending champion. \"But if this year goes well and the Commonwealths go well then a European medal might be a possibility for him. But that\\'s not a decision he\\'s finalised yet.\" Pittman and Rawlison plan to marry after the 2006 Commonwealth Games.\\nJones doping probe begins\\n\\nAn investigation into doping claims against Marion Jones has been opened by the International Olympic Committee.\\n\\nIOC president Jacques Rogge has set up a disciplinary body to look into claims by Victor Conte, of Balco Laboratories. Jones, who says she is innocent, could lose all her Olympic medals after Conte said he gave her performance-enhancing drugs before the Sydney Olympics. But Rogge said it was too early to speculate about that, hoping only that \"the truth will emerge\".\\n\\nAny decision on the medals would be taken by the IOC\\'s executive board and could hinge on interpretation of a rule stating that Olympic decisions can only be challenged within three years of the Games closing. The Sydney Olympics ended more than four years ago, but World Anti-Doping Agency chief Dick Pound said the rule may not apply because the allegations are only coming out now. \"We will find a way to deal with that,\" Pound said. In a statement released through her attorney Rich Nichols, Jones repeated her innocence and vowed she would be cleared. \"Victor Conte\\'s allegations are not true and the truth will be revealed for the world to see as the legal process moves forward,\" she said. \"Conte is someone who is under federal indictment and has a record of issuing contradictory, inconsistent statements.\"\\nVerdict delay for Greek sprinters\\n\\nGreek athletics\\' governing body has postponed by two weeks the judgement on sprinters Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou for missing doping tests.\\n\\nThe pair are facing lengthy bans for the missed tests, including one on the eve of last year\\'s Athens Olympics. They were set to learn their fate by the end of February, but late evidence from them has pushed the date back. \"A decision is now expected by around mid-March,\" said one of their lawyers, Michalis Dimitrakopoulos. Kenteris, 31, who won the men\\'s 200m title at the 2000 Sydney Games and Thanou, 30, who won the women\\'s 100m silver medal in Sydney, face a maximum two-year ban if found guilty. The athletes, who spectacularly withdrew from the Athens Olympics, have been suspended by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for missing the three tests. The IAAF said the sprinters had failed to provide samples for tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and ordered Greek athletic\\'s governing body, Segas, to hold a disciplinary inquiry. The athletes also face a criminal hearing in Greece over the missed drugs tests and have been charged with faking a motorcycle accident on the day of the Athens test, which led to them spending four days in hospital. Following the final hearing in late January, the athletes sounded confident they would be acquitted. \"I am confident and optimistic,\" Thanou had said at the time. \"We presented new evidence to the committee that they were not aware of.\" It was not clear what this new evidence was.\\nDibaba breaks 5,000m world record\\n\\nEthiopia\\'s Tirunesh Dibaba set a new world record in winning the women\\'s 5,000m at the Boston Indoor Games.\\n\\nDibaba won in 14 minutes 32.93 seconds to erase the previous world indoor mark of 14:39.29 set by another Ethiopian, Berhane Adera, in Stuttgart last year. But compatriot Kenenisa Bekele\\'s record hopes were dashed when he miscounted his laps in the men\\'s 3,000m and staged his sprint finish a lap too soon. Ireland\\'s Alistair Cragg won in 7:39.89 as Bekele battled to second in 7:41.42. \"I didn\\'t want to sit back and get out-kicked,\" said Cragg. \"So I kept on the pace. The plan was to go with 500m to go no matter what, but when Bekele made the mistake that was it. The race was mine.\" Sweden\\'s Carolina Kluft, the Olympic heptathlon champion, and Slovenia\\'s Jolanda Ceplak had winning performances, too. Kluft took the long jump at 6.63m, while Ceplak easily won the women\\'s 800m in 2:01.52.\\nEuropean medal chances improve\\n\\nWhat have the European Indoor trials told us? Well, I think we could be heading to the European Championships with half a dozen medal prospects.\\n\\nIt was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward, to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around.\\n\\nThe best performance on the track for me was Sarah Claxton\\'s win in the 60m hurdles. Running sub-eight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in Madrid she will be close to picking up a medal. But what was great about Sunday\\'s performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted. Diane Allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and I think she was surprised to be beaten by Sarah. And knowing that she got the better of Diane in a head-to-head race will give Sarah confidence. In the men\\'s race on Saturday, Allan Scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him. In fact, the men\\'s 60m hurdles is so strong, I think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to Madrid.\\n\\nPhillips Idowu lit up the field events, not only with his hair, but also with his leap of 17.30m, which puts him at the top of the world rankings. I had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there. He feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him - but then Phillips always has. A lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful, so for Phillips to jump like that is a good performance. He is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency - and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further. Across the board I thought Kelly Sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing. She picked up three personal bests in the long jump, high jump and 60m hurdles and you can\\'t ask for more than that. Kelly will be up against Carolina Kluft in the pentathlon at the European Championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what we\\'ve seen so far.\\n\\nShe has a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well. It wasn\\'t all good news in Sheffield. I thought both the 60m races were disappointing in different ways. Jason Gardener may have won but he wasn\\'t at his best. I chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an off-day for him. He\\'s there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got a big scalp out there. In the women\\'s race, Jeanette Kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion Joice Maduaka. The pair are enjoying a bit of rivalry but Joice had to pull out with a chest infection. If she had made the final I think Jeanette would have gone a bit quicker.\\n\\nJanine Whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following a two-year drugs ban. But the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by a long way and that shouldn\\'t be the case. The event has moved on immensely since Janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition I think that would help her. A couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding Mark Findlay and Rabah Yusuf. Findlay is a Londoner who has chosen to represent Trinidad and Tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for Great Britain. Yusuf, who came third in the 400m, is from the Sudan but is trying to gain British citizenship. He came to Britain as a high jumper but damaged his toe, started doing more running and found his talent. So we shall have to see what happens to both of them.\\nGebrselassie in London triple bid\\n\\nDouble Olympic 10,000m champion Haile Gebrselassie will race in the London Marathon for the next three years.\\n\\nThe Ethiopian legend won Sunday\\'s Almeria half-marathon in Spain on his return from an operation on his Achilles tendon. He was third in London in 2002 in his first serious attempt at the marathon. \"It is a coup for us to secure Haile\\'s presence for the next three years and it guarantees a quality race,\" said race director David Bedford. Gebrselassie will face Olympic champion Stefano Baldini, world champion Jaouad Gharib, and arch-rival Paul Tergat, the current world record holder. \"If I didn\\'t think I could win I would not be here,\" said Gebrselassie, who has set world records on 18 occasions in his illustrious career and is keen to add the marathon record to his collection. \"There are a lot of fantastic runners in the race but I shall be doing my utmost to upset them.\"\\nDisappointed Scott in solid start\\n\\nAllan Scott is confident of winning a medal at next week\\'s European Indoor Championships after a solid debut on the international circuit.\\n\\nThe 22-year-old Scot finished fourth in the 60m hurdles at the Jose M Cagigal Memorial meeting in Madrid. \"It was definitely a learning curve and I certainly haven\\'t ruled out challenging for a medal next week,\" said the East Kilbride athlete. The race was won by Felipe Vivancos, who equalled the Spanish record.\\n\\nSweden\\'s Robert Kronberg was second, with Haiti\\'s Dudley Dorival in third. Scott was slightly disappointed with his run in the final. He won his heat in 7.64secs but ran 0.04secs slower in his first IAAF Indoor Grand Prix circuit final. \"I should have done better than that,\" he said. \"I felt I could have won it. I got a poor start - but I still felt I should have ran faster.\" Vivancos slashed his personal best to equal the Spanish record with a time of 7.60secs while Kronberg and Dorival clocked 7.62secs and 7.63secs respectively.\\nSprinter Walker quits athletics\\n\\nFormer European 200m champion Dougie Walker is to retire from athletics after a series of six operations left him struggling for fitness.\\n\\nWalker had hoped to compete in the New Year Sprint which is staged at Musselburgh Racecourse near Edinburgh on Tuesday and Wednesday. The 31-year-old Scot was suspended for two years in 1998 after testing positive for nandrolone. \"I had intended to race but I\\'m running like a goon,\" said Walker. He told the Herald newspaper: \"I\\'m not in great shape, after missing about a month of training. \"I missed a big chunk of speed work over about three weeks, and then another week working in America. \"If I\\'d had a half-decent mark it might have motivated me more, but I won\\'t be racing. \"I still enjoy training, but feel it\\'s time to move on, and concentrate on a career.\"\\nEl Guerrouj targets cross country\\n\\nDouble Olympic champion Hicham El Guerrouj is set to make a rare appearance at the World Cross Country Championships in France.\\n\\nBut the Moroccan, who has not raced over cross country for 15 years, will not decide until two weeks before the event which starts on 19 March. \"If I am to compete in it, it is only if I feel I can win,\" said the 30-year-old, who is retiring in 2006. \"Otherwise there is not much point in me going.\" El Guerrouj achieved a lifetime ambition last August when he clinched his first Olympic titles over 1500m and 5,000m. But the four-time world 1500m champion is still hungry for more success before calling time on his career. The 30-year-old has set his sights on clinching the world 5,000m crown in Helsinki this summer. And he is aiming to break 10,000m Olympic champion Kenenisa Bekele\\'s 5,000m and 10,000m world records.\\n\\nEl Guerrouj could meet Bekele in March as the Ethiopian is the defending world cross country champion over both the long and short courses. But the Moroccan will not commit himself to the St Galmier event until he assesses how well his winter training is going. \"The return to training was very difficult because I accepted a lot of invitations these past few months,\" said El Guerrouj. \"I am almost a month behind but I am on the right track.\"\\n\\n\\n - Britain\\'s Paula Radcliffe has also not ruled out competing in the World Cross Country Championships. \"I haven\\'t quite decided what events I will compete in prior to London but the World Cross Country is an event which is also special to me and is a definite possibility,\" said the two-time champion.\\nGreene to compete in Birmingham\\n\\nMaurice Greene will go head-to-head with Britain\\'s Olympic gold medallists Mark Lewis-Francis and Jason Gardener over 60m in Birmingham next month.\\n\\nThe race at the National Indoor Arena on 18 February will give Greene the chance to avenge America\\'s 4x100m relay defeat by the British team. Greene, who set the 60m world record of 6.39 seconds in 1998, won bronze in the 100m in Athens. But he was beaten to the line on the relay anchor leg by Lewis-Francis. \"I\\'m really looking forward to competing in Birmingham again,\" said Greene. \"The support from the crowd at the NIA is always fantastic and I\\'m sure I can rise to the occasion and produce a great performance.\"\\n\\nDouble Olympic gold medallist Kelly Holmes has also signed up to race in Birmingham. Olympic heptathlon champion Carolina Kluft, pole vault world record holder Yelena Isinbayeva and Kenenisa Bekele, the 5,000m and 10,000m world record holder, will also compete.\\nBritain boosted by Holmes double\\n\\nAthletics fans endured a year of mixed emotions in 2004 as stunning victories went hand-in-hand with disappointing defeats and more drugs scandals.\\n\\nKelly Holmes finally fulfilled her potential by storming to double gold on the track at the Olympic Games. Holmes helped erase the gloom hanging over Team GB after their biggest medal hope, Paula Radcliffe, dropped out of the marathon and then the 10,000m. Britain\\'s men\\'s 4x100m relay team also did their bit by taking a shock gold. Holmes had started the year in disappointing style, falling over in the final of 1500m at the World Indoor Championships where she was favourite. Her Olympic build-up was clouded by self doubt but that proved unfounded as she overhauled rival Maria Mutola to win the 800m - her first global title. Just five days later, the 34-year-old made it double gold in the 1500m. It was the first time in 84 years a Briton has achieved the Olympic middle-distance double. While Holmes left Athens as the star of Team GB, it was Radcliffe who carried expectations before the August Games.\\n\\nThe 30-year-old marathon world record holder went into the Athens event as favourite but an exhausted Radcliffe dropped out after 23 miles in tears. Her decision to enter the 10,000m five days later also backfired as she again pulled out with eight laps remaining.\\n\\nBut Radcliffe helped put her Olympic trauma behind her with a thrilling win in November\\'s New York Marathon. The 4x100m team grabbed some last-gasp glory for the British men\\'s Olympic squad after a poor start to the Games.\\n\\nIt seemed as though Athens would be the first Games where the men would fail to win a medal with Michael East the only individual track finalist in the 1500m. But Darren Campell, Jason Gardener, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis made amends in the sprint relay. The quartet held off favourites the USA to win Britain\\'s first relay medal since 1912 in 38.07 seconds. Gardener added the Olympic relay crown to his World Indoor title over 60m and, just like Holmes, finally lived up to his promise in 2004. Kelly Sotherton completed Team GB\\'s athletics medal haul in Athens with a surprise bronze in the heptathlon. The 28-year-old won her first championship medal since becoming a full-time athlete in 2003.\\n\\nBut it was a different story for Britain\\'s defending champion Denise Lewis, who withdrew on day two of the competition after some poor results. Lewis, who was troubled by injury, has ruled out retiring while Sotherton is tipped to build on her success. The Athens Olympics proved to be a landmark occasion for Steve Backley, who retired from competition after finishing fourth in the javelin. The battling 35-year-old leaves the sport with a vast medal haul including two silvers and one Olympic bronze.\\n\\nAnd Backley\\'s departure was balanced by the return of injury-hit decathlete Dean Macey, who came fourth in Athens.\\n\\nThe continued improvement of sprinter Abi Oyepitan and long jumper Chris Tomlinson also boosted Team GB. Sadly, the 2004 Olympics did not escape the problems of drugs misuse. On the eve of the Games, Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou missed a drugs test and claimed to have been involved in a road crash.\\n\\nKenteris, the 200m champion in 2000, and Thanou have since been charged by the Greek authorities and await trial. At the Games, Adrian Annus (hammer), Robert Fazelas (discus) and Irina Korzhanenko (shot) were all stripped of their titles because of doping issues. Hungarian compatriots Annus and Fazelas both refused to give urine samples while Russian Korzhanenko tested positive for the steroid stanozolol.\\n\\nThe fallout from the THG scandal, which rocked the sport in 2003, continued to impact in Olympic year. Britain\\'s 4x100m team took gold without the services of Dwain Chambers, who was handed a two-year ban in February after testing positive for steroid THG.\\n\\nAmerican Kelli White was suspended and stripped of her world 100m and 200m titles after failing a drugs test. And world 400m champion Jerome Young landed a life ban from US chiefs after a second doping offence. Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva provided some light relief by smashing the world record seven times on her way to the World Indoor and Olympic titles. Her rivalry with compatriot Svetlana Feofanova livened up the field events. Morocco\\'s Hicham El Guerrouj also delighted fans by racing to a historic Olympic double in the 1500m and 5,000m.\\n\\nAnd though there was no Paula Radcliffe in the London Marathon, there was plenty of drama as Kenyans Evans Rutto and Margaret Okayo took the titles. Rutto held on to win despite slipping on some cobblestones and tumbling into a barrier. Okayo also had to battle back after mistiming her tactics but clinched victory on her debut.\\nGardener wins double in Glasgow\\n\\nBritain\\'s Jason Gardener enjoyed a double 60m success in Glasgow in his first competitive outing since he won 100m relay gold at the Athens Olympics.\\n\\nGardener cruised home ahead of Scot Nick Smith to win the invitational race at the Norwich Union International. He then recovered from a poor start in the second race to beat Swede Daniel Persson and Italy\\'s Luca Verdecchia. His times of 6.61 and 6.62 seconds were well short of American Maurice Greene\\'s 60m world record of 6.39secs from 1998. \"It\\'s a very hard record to break, but I believe I\\'ve trained very well,\" said the world indoor champion, who hopes to get closer to the mark this season. \"It was important to come out and make sure I got maximum points. My last race was the Olympic final and there was a lot of expectation. \"This was just what I needed to sharpen up and get some race fitness. I\\'m very excited about the next couple of months.\"\\n\\nDouble Olympic champion\\n\\nmarked her first appearance on home soil since winning 1500m and 800m gold in Athens with a victory. There was a third success for Britain when\\n\\nedged out Russia\\'s Olga Fedorova and Sweden\\'s Jenny Kallur to win the women\\'s 60m race in 7.23secs. Maduaka was unable to repeat the feat in the 200m, finishing down in fourth as\\n\\ntook the win for Russia. And the 31-year-old also missed out on a podium place in the 4x200m relay as the British quartet came in fourth, with Russia setting a new world indoor record. There was a setback for Jade Johnson as she suffered a recurrence of her back injury in the long jump. Russia won the meeting with a final total of 63 points, with Britain second on 48 and France one point behind in third.\\n\\nled the way for Russia by producing a major shock in the high jump as he beat Olympic champion Stefan Holm into second place to end the Swede\\'s 22-event unbeaten record.\\n\\nwon the triple jump with a leap of 16.87m, with Britain\\'s Tosin Oke fourth in 15.80m.\\n\\nwon the men\\'s pole vault competition with a clearance of 5.65m, with Britain\\'s Nick Buckfield 51cm adrift of his personal best in third. And\\n\\nwon the women\\'s 800m, with Britain\\'s Jenny Meadows third. There was yet another Russian victory in the women\\'s 400m as\\n\\nfinished well clear of Britain\\'s Catherine Murphy. Chris Lambert had to settle for fourth after fading in the closing stages of the men\\'s 200m race as Sweden\\'s\\n\\nheld off Leslie Djhone of France. France\\'s\\n\\nwon the men\\'s 400m, with Brett Rund fourth for Britain.\\n\\ntook victory for Sweden in the women\\'s 60m hurdles ahead of Russia\\'s Irina Shevchenko and Britain\\'s Sarah Claxton, who set a new personal best. Italy grabbed their first victory in the men\\'s 1500m as\\n\\nkicked over the last 200 metres to hold off Britain\\'s James Thie and France\\'s Alexis Abraham. A botched changeover in the 4x200m relay cost Britain\\'s men the chance to add further points as France claimed victory.\\nWhite admits to Balco drugs link\\n\\nBanned American sprinter Kelli White says she knowingly took steroids given to her by Bay Area Lab Co-Operative (Balco) president Victor Conte.\\n\\nConte faces a federal trial next year on charges of distributing steroids and tax evasion, and White said at first he tried to cover up what he was doing. \"He\\'s the one who told me that it wasn\\'t what he said it was,\" White said in the San Francisco Chronicle. But she added: \"It was my decision to go to him, not anybody else\\'s.\" White said Conte at first told her the substance was flaxseed oil, only to change his story later. White failed a drugs test after winning the 100m and 200m titles at the 2003 world athletics championships. She was subsequently handed a two-year ban in May this year and has admitted taking the stimulant modafinil. At first, White claimed she took the drug to combat narcolepsy but she now takes full responsibility for her actions.\\n\\n\"My whole belief about Victor is that he was selling a product,\" White said in the LA Times. \"Whether it be a good product or a bad product, he was selling a product.\" White was introduced to Conte through her coach Remy Korchemy, who is also a defendant in the Balco case. The 27-year-old believes doping is so common in sport she felt compelled to cheat herself if she was to have any chance of winning. \"I have no clue what it\\'s going to take to change that,\" said White. \"I would say I made a mistake and I would never, ever go back. \"I would never recommend anyone to take that route.\"\\nGreek pair attend drugs hearing\\n\\nGreek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou have appeared before an independent tribunal which will decide if their bans should stand.\\n\\nThey were given provisional suspensions by athletics\\' ruling body the IAAF in December for failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics. The pair arrived with former coach Christos Tzekos to give evidence at the Hellenic Olympic Committee\\'s offices. A decision is expected to be announced before the end of February. Whatever the ruling, all parties will have the right to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Yiannis Papadoyiannakis, who was head of the Greek Olympic team at the Athens Games last year, also testified at the tribunal, along with other Greek sports officials and athletes. \"I believe the tribunal will reach a decision that will uphold the standing of the institution,\" said Papadoyiannakis. \"Whatever the athletes have done, we must not forget that they have offered us great moments.\" Kenteris won 200m gold at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, while Thanou won silver in the 100m.\\n\\nThey withdrew from the Athens Games last August after missing drugs tests on the eve of the opening ceremony. The pair spent four days in a hospital, claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. The five-member tribunal, assembled by the Hellenic Association of Amateur Athletics, is also examining allegations that Kenteris and Thanou avoided tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago before the Games. Tzekos was also banned for two years by the IAAF. He faces charges of assisting in the use of prohibited substances and tampering with the doping inspection process. All three, who have repeatedly denied the allegations, have also been charged by a Greek prosecutor and face trial for doping-related charges. A trial date has not been set. In imposing two-year suspensions on the duo on 22 December, the IAAF described their explanations for missing the tests as \"unacceptable\". But Kenteris\\' lawyer Gregory Ioannidis told BBC Sport earlier this week he was confident the sprinters would be cleared of the charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to testing. \"We refute both charges as unsubstantiated and illogical,\" he said. \"There have been certain breaches in the correct application of the rules on behalf of the sporting authorities and their officials, and these procedural breaches have also violated my client\\'s rights. \"There is also evidence that proves the fact that my client has been persecuted.\"\\nHolmes urged to compete at Worlds\\n\\nJolanda Ceplak has urged Britain\\'s Kelly Holmes to continue competing at the major championships.\\n\\nDouble Olympic gold medallist Holmes has strongly hinted she will not run in this year\\'s Worlds and is undecided about next month\\'s European Indoors. But World Indoor 800m record holder Ceplak said: \"There is never an easy race when she is in the field. There is only excitement at what might happen. \"It is good for the sport. She always fetches the best out of everyone.\" Ceplak has been a great rival of Holmes\\' during the Briton\\'s career and the pair fell out when Holmes questioned the manner of the Slovenian\\'s runaway 800m victory at the 2002 European Championships. But the controversy has since been forgotten, with Ceplak acting as pacemaker for Holmes\\' failed attempt on the British Indoor 1500m record at the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham in 2003.\\n\\nCeplak added: \"I like running against her - you know the race is always going to be fast. \"That is the sort of competition that I like. She is special to me. She was like my idol from the beginning of my career.\" Meanwhile, Ceplak will be looking to follow up last Saturday\\'s win in Boston with a fast time and victory in Friday\\'s Night of Athletics in Erfurt, Germany. Britain\\'s Jason Gardener had been expected to defend his 60m title in Erfurt but instead he will save himself for a competition in Leipzig on Sunday. Gardener\\'s decision means Scotland\\'s 400m man Ian Mackie will carry British hopes in what looks sure to be a tough preparation for next weekend\\'s Norwich Union European trials in Sheffield.\\nJohnson edges out rival Sotherton\\n\\nJade Johnson edged out rival Kelly Sotherton with her last effort to claim the AAAs long jump title at the Norwich Union European Indoor trials.\\n\\nOlympic heptathlon bronze medallist, Sotherton, led the event with her first leap of 6.43m - a personal best. But Johnson, who has not competed indoors for five years, leapt to a life-time best of 6.50m in her last jump, after four fouls. Both Johnson and Sotherton passed the European Championships qualifying mark. Although Sotherton\\'s main aim in Madrid next month will be the pentathlon where she will take on Olympic heptathlon champion Carolina Kluft. Ireland\\'s\\n\\ndelivered a shock in the men\\'s 200m as he stormed to his first major title in 21.01 seconds. British favourite Chris Lambert had to settle for second place while defending champion Ireland\\'s Paul Brizzel took third. There was some consolation for Lambert as he set a personal best of 20.94 in the first round - good enough to qualify for Europe.\\n\\nTwo-time AAAs champion Allyn Condon and Ian Mackie had no such luck as they were disqualified in the heats. There was plenty of hot action in the men\\'s 60m hurdles where Scotland\\'s\\n\\nwas vying for top spot with Olympian Andy Turner. Scott, 22, smashed his personal best on the way to the final, where he broke it again to win the AAAs title in 7.58 seconds. Turner finished second in 7.82 after previously setting a personal best on the 7.83 in the semi-finals, while Damien Greaves did not finish the final. The trio of athletes have reached the European qualifying mark this season though one of them is set to miss out on a call-up to the British squad.\\n\\ncomfortably defended her 3,000m title, clocking eight minutes, 49.87 seconds to easily surpass the European qualifying mark. The European cross country bronze medallist is ranked number one in Europe this season and will go to Madrid with high hopes. Helen Clitheroe was agonisingly close to the 9:05.00 qualifying mark as she claimed the runners-up spot in a personal best of 9:05.73. In the men\\'s 800m heats,\\n\\nqualified fastest in the 800m heats to lay down a challenge to in-form\\n\\n. The Welsh runner attacked the last 200m to come through ahead of James Thie in one minute, 49.87 seconds. McIlroy, who is third in the European rankings, eased across the finish in 1:50.87 to set up a showdown in Sunday\\'s final in Sheffield. Both Watkins and McIlroy have already achieved the European qualifying mark. Scotland\\'s Susan Deacon stole\\n\\n\\'s thunder in the final of the women\\'s 200m. Fraser became the fastest British woman over the distance this season when she qualified for the final in 23.68 seconds - though that time is outside the European standard. But Deacon claimed her first AAAs title over the distance, edging Fraser into second in 23.67. In the women\\'s shot put veteran\\n\\nclaimed her fourth AAAs title with a throw of 15.27m. But that mark was not good enough for the 39-year-old to book her place at next month\\'s European Indoor Championships in Madrid. Sotherton finished fifth after producing two throws of 13.77m. In the absence of injured British number one Carl Myerscough,\\n\\nclaimed the men\\'s shot put title with a throw of 17.64m, which was below the qualifying mark.\\n\\nSale\\'s Robert Mitchell climbed to a season\\'s best of 2.20m - just 3cm short of the European standard - to claim the British indoor high jump title.\\n\\ncould only clear 2.16m to finish in fourth but the 27-year-old\\'s disappointment will be tempered as he had already achieved the qualifying mark at a meeting in Slovenia on Tuesday. There was bad luck for British number one\\n\\nin the pole vault as he failed to clear the bar after deciding to come in at 5.45m. The AAAs indoor title went instead to Ashley Swain, who climbed to a season\\'s best of 5.25m And Ireland\\'s Taniesha Scanlon set a new national record of 13.28m in the women\\'s triple jump.\\nGB quartet get cross country call\\n\\nFour British athletes have been pre-selected to compete at the World Cross Country Championships in March after impressive starts to the season.\\n\\nHayley Yelling, Jo Pavey, Karl Keska and Adam Hickey will represent Team GB at the event in France. Yelling clinched the women\\'s European cross country title last month and Pavey followed up with bronze. Keska helped the men\\'s team to overall third place while Hickey finished in 10th place on his junior debut. \"Winning the European cross country title meant so much to me,\" said Yelling. \"And being pre-selected for the Worlds means that I can focus on preparing in the best way possible.\" The 32-year-old will race alongside Olympic 5,000m finalist Pavey in the women\\'s 8km race on 19 March. Keska, who has made a successful return from a long-term injury lay-off, contests the men\\'s 12km race on 20 March, while 16-year-old Hickey goes in the junior men\\'s 8km on the same day. The rest of the team will be named after the trials at Wollaton Park in Nottingham, which take place on 5 March.\\nBalco case trial date pushed back\\n\\nThe trial date for the Bay Area Laboratory Cooperative (Balco) steroid distribution case has been postponed.\\n\\nUS judge Susan Illston pushed back a preliminary evidentiary hearing - which was due to take place on Wednesday - until 6 June. No official trial date has been set but it is expected to begin in September. Balco founder Victor Conte along with James Valente, coach Remy Korchemny and trainer Greg Anderson are charged with distributing steroids to athletes.\\n\\nAnderson\\'s clients include Barry Bonds, and several other baseball stars have been asked to appear before a congressional inquiry into steroid use in the major leagues. The Balco defence team have already lost their appeal to have the case dismissed at a pre-trial hearing in San Francisco but will still argue the case should not go to trial. The hearing in June will focus on the admissibility of evidence gathered during police raids on Balco\\'s offices and Anderson\\'s home. Conte and Anderson were not arrested at that point but federal agents did obtain statements from them. The defence are expected to challenge the legality of those interviews and if Ilston agrees she could could reject all the evidence from the raids. Balco has been accused by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) of being the source of the banned steroid THG and modafinil.\\n\\nFormer double world champion Kelli White and Olympic relay star Alvin Harrison have both been banned on the basis of materials discovered during the Balco investigation. Britain\\'s former European 100m champion Dwain Chambers is currently serving a two-year ban after testing positive for THG in an out-of-competition test in 2003. And American sprinter Marion Jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against Conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.\\nRadcliffe enjoys winning comeback\\n\\nPaula Radcliffe made a triumphant return to competitive running with victory in the New York Marathon.\\n\\nThe Briton, running for the first time since dropping out of the Olympic marathon and 10,000m, held off Kenyan Susan Chepkemei in a thrilling finish. The pair were locked together for the last few miles before Radcliffe finally sprinted clear to win in two hours, 23 minutes and 10 seconds. \"It\\'s a good way to end the year,\" she said. \"I\\'m ready for a good rest now.\" Radcliffe decided only recently to run in the race and many had doubted whether she had sufficiently recovered from her Olympic ordeal just 11 weeks ago. But the world record-holder was prominent at the head of the field for the whole race as her rivals slowly dropped off the pace. Just Chepkemei and Radcliffe were left in contention as the race came into the final few miles. The Kenyan put in several bursts of speed to throw off Radcliffe but the Briton managed to hang in. Both runners looked to be suffering as they reached the final mile in Central Park. But it was Radcliffe who managed to dredge up a final sprint to see off Chepkemei in the closest finish in the race\\'s history and in the process make a huge step in erasing the disappointment she suffered in Athens.\\n\\n\\nHolmes secures comeback victory\\n\\nBritain\\'s Kelly Holmes marked her first appearance on home soil since winning double Olympic gold with 1500m victory at the Norwich Union International.\\n\\nHolmes hit the front just before the bell in front of a sell-out crowd in Glasgow and cruised to victory in a time of four minutes 14.74 seconds. \"It was nice to get that out of the way. I was nervous about whether I would actually be able to get round. \"I felt good. I just had to relax and use my racing knowledge,\" said Holmes. \"It was all about winning in front of my home crowd. The time is irrelevant. \"I got round in one piece and didn\\'t disgrace myself. Now it\\'s about going forward. \"The reception I\\'ve had since the Olympics has been amazing and that\\'s why I wanted to keep running this year, because I get a buzz from the crowd.\" Holmes ran a tactically perfect race to finish clear of France\\'s Hind Dehiba and Russia\\'s Svetlana Cherkasova. The Olympic 800m and 1500m champion\\'s time was inside the qualifying mark for the European Indoor Championships in Madrid in March. But the 34-year-old would not reveal whether she intended to run or not, having previously indicated she would leave a decision until after the Birmingham Grand Prix on 18 February.\\nJohnson too strong for GB runners\\n\\nBritain\\'s Kathy Butler and Hayley Yelling were no match for Benita Johnson in the 51st Cross International Zornotza in Amorebieta, Spain.\\n\\nButler and Yelling finished fourth and fifth as Australian world champion Johnson romped to a five-second victory in the 6km race ahead of Edith Masai. Masai\\'s fellow Kenyan Alice Timbilil finished third. Johnson said: \"I ran comfortably for the first 3km and then I tried to leave the others but it wasn\\'t an easy task.\" Butler clocked a time of 22 minutes 45 seconds - 22secs behind the winner but four ahead of Yelling, who last month succeeded Paula Radcliffe as European champion. Johnson, will be one of the star attractions at the Great EdinburghInternational Cross Country on 15 January.\\nGardener battles to narrow win\\n\\nJason Gardener fought all the way to the line to narrowly claim the men\\'s 60m title at the Norwich Union Indoor trials and AAAs Championships.\\n\\nThe world 60m champion got off to a rolling start and had to dig deep to dip ahead of Mark Findlay and Darren Chin, who both set personal bests. \"It was a close race,\" admitted Gardener. \"I stumbled out the blocks but my experience told through. \"I still feel there\\'s more life in me and I believe I can go faster.\" Gardener\\'s performance in Sheffield could have been affected by the news, which he heard before his semi-final, that his European record had been broken Frenchman Ronald Pognon, who will be a real threat at the European Championships, set a new time of 6.45, one-hundreth of a second faster than Gardener\\'s previous mark. Favourite\\n\\ndelivered a powerful performance to take the women\\'s 60m title in 7.27 seconds. \"You\\'ll see me in Madrid and I feel there is a lot more to come along,\" said the 22-year-old. Katherine Endacott battled hard to take second and dip under the European qualifying mark. Defending champion Joice Maduaka had pulled out of the final with a chest infection.\\n\\nwas on record-breaking form as she stormed to the women\\'s 60m hurdles crown. The 25-year-old set a new British record for the second time in seven days, clocking 7.96 seconds to finish ahead of rival Diane Allahgreen. \"I\\'m so happy,\" a tearful Claxton told BBC Sport. \"All the years I\\'ve been running and I\\'m getting recognition.\" Claxton\\'s time was also good enough to qualify for the European Championships.\\n\\nThe men\\'s 800m went to form in Sheffield as\\n\\ndominated the race from start to finish. The Northern Ireland athlete went off at a startling pace but had to hold off the challenge of Welshman Jimmy Watkins over the final 200m to win in one minute, 47.96 seconds. Both McIlory and Watkins, who set a life-time best of 1:48.32, had already booked their places in Madrid and were again well within the qualifying time. \"I had to go out and go through all the gears before the Europeans and I won\\'t run again until then,\" said McIlroy.\\n\\ncould not reach the European mark in the women\\'s race as she crossed the line to win in 2:04.45. Olympic bronze heptathlon medallist\\n\\nrounded off a useful weekend with two more personal bests in Sheffield. The 28-year-old reached 1.80m in the high jump and clocked 8.47secs in the heats of the 60m hurdles. \"I\\'ve surprised myself,\" said Sotherton. \"I\\'m starting to thrive on the pressure but if I don\\'t perform then it\\'s not the end of the world.\" Pole vaulter\\n\\nmade a winning return to major competition after a drugs ban. The Trafford athlete, who has served a two-year ban after testing positive for anabolic steroids, clinched the title with a championship record 4.25m.\\n\\nalso set a new championship mark in the men\\'s triple jump title in Sheffield. The 26-year-old, who has been training in Australia over the winter, landed 17.30m with his final effort - the longest leap in the world this year. \"I didn\\'t have a clue,\" said Idowu. \"I\\'ve not jumped indoors before and I just wanted the qualifying mark. \"But this isn\\'t a bad start and hopefully I\\'ll come back from Madrid with a gold medal.\" Nathan Douglas continued his steady progress this season as he set a life-time best of 16.76m in second while Jonathan Moore took third.\\n\\nand\\n\\nresumed their rivalry in the long jump competition, both achieving the European standard. Commonwealth champion Morgan reached a personal best of 7.96m on his very first jump and then promptly retired with a bruised heel. Olympian Tomlinson tried to play catch up with his six jumps but had to settle for a season\\'s best jump of 7.91m. \"I was advised not to jump by my doctor and so I\\'m pleased to come here and get the qualifying mark,\" said Tomlinson.\\n\\n, now based at Loughborough, sprinted past front runner Catherine Murphy in the final 100m to steal the women\\'s 400m title. The 21-year-old ran a personal best of 53.45 seconds to win her first indoor title. Wall\\'s time was just short of the qualifying mark - something Murphy already has. Ireland\\'s\\n\\ntook the men\\'s title in 46.46 ahead of promising Channel Islands decathlete Dale Garland. Sudanese 18-year-old Rabah Yusuf, who is seeking British citizenship, showed his raw talent as he burst through in third.\\n\\ncleared the required 1.90m to qualify for the European championships and claim the AAAs title in the women\\'s high jump. In the men\\'s 3,000m,\\n\\npowered to a new personal best of seven minutes, 56.86 seconds to defend his AAAs title in style. It was the first time in 11 years the eight-minute barrier has been broken at the championships and was just within the European mark.\\n\\ntook the women\\'s 1500m AAAs title in the absence of Kelly Holmes. Her time of 4:19.11 was not good enough to qualify for Madrid but Ovens had already opted out of the championships. The men\\'s race was won by\\n\\n, who had to fight off a closing pack to claim the title in 3:45.87.\\nKluft impressed by Sotherton form\\n\\nOlympic heptathlon champion Carolina Kluft was full of admiration for Britain\\'s Kelly Sotherton as the pair prepared to clash in Birmingham.\\n\\nBoth will be in action on Friday in the 60m hurdles and long jump ahead of the European Indoor Championships later this month in Madrid. Sotherton finished third behind the Swede in Athens, and Kluft said: \"I knew about her, she\\'s a great girl. \"She looked very good early in the season and was competing really well.\" Kluft showed impressive early-season form on Tuesday in Stockholm\\'s GE Galan meeting, winning the sprint hurdles, the long jump and the 400m. Sotherton has also displayed promise, with a new high jump personal best in Sheffield at the combined Norwich Union European trials and AAA Championships, and a second place in the long jump behind Jade Johnson.\\nThanou bullish over drugs hearing\\n\\nKaterina Thanou is confident she and fellow sprinter Kostas Kenteris will not be punished for missing drugs tests before the Athens Olympics.\\n\\nThe Greek pair appeared at a hearing on Saturday which will determine whether their provisional bans from athletics\\' ruling body the IAAF should stand. \"After five months we finally had the chance to give explanations. I am confident and optimistic,\" said Thanou. \"We presented new evidence to the committee that they were not aware of.\"\\n\\nThe athletes\\' lawyer Grigoris Ioanidis said he believed the independent disciplinary committee set up by the Greek Athletics Federation (SEGAS) would find them innocent. \"We are almost certain that the charges will be dropped,\" said Ioanidis.\\n\\n\"We believe that we have presented [a case] that the charges are unreasonable.\" Thanou, the 2000 Olympic women\\'s 100m silver medallist, and Sydney 200m champion Kenteris were suspended by the IAAF for missing three drugs tests. The third was supposed to take place on the eve of the Athens Games last August, but the pair could not be found in the athletes\\' village. They were later taken to hospital after claiming to have been involved in a motorcycle accident. Thanou\\'s coach Christos Tzekos was also suspended by the IAAF. \"We were asked [by the disciplinary committee] all kinds of questions about the night of 12 August,\" said Tzekos. \"We did not leave any gaps. As far as I am concerned there is no such issue [of refusing to be tested], and I am very optimistic.\" Tzekos, Thanou and Kenteris, who have all denied the charges, can expect a decision within a month. \"Deliberations will start after some additional documents are brought in by Thursday,\" said committee chairman Kostas Panagopoulos. \"I estimate that the final ruling will be issued by the end of February.\"\\nChepkemei joins Edinburgh line-up\\n\\nSusan Chepkemei has decided she is fit enough to run in next month\\'s Great Edinburgh International Cross Country.\\n\\nThe Kenyan was initially unsure if she would have recovered from her gruelling tussle with Paula Radcliffe in the New York Marathon in time to compete. But she has declared herself up to the task and joins a field headed by World cross country champion Benita Johnson. Race director Matthew Turnbull said: \"Susan will add even more strength in depth to the world-class line up.\" Chepkemei, who won the six kilometre event three years ago when it was staged in Newcastle, endured an epic battle with Radcliffe in the Big Apple until the Briton outsprinted her in the final 400m. Tirunesh Dibaba of Ethiopia will defend the title she won last year in Tyneside - before the race was moved north of the border. Recently-crowned European cross country champion Briton Hayley Yelling also competes in Edinburgh on 15 January, as does in-form Scot Kathy Butler.\\nRecord fails to lift lacklustre meet\\n\\nYelena Isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record, but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in Birmingham.\\n\\nAnd hey, there are not many meets that go by without the Russian breaking a world record.\\n\\nApparently, Isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and I would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a time. Athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can, and I would like to see her have a go at 5m in competition. Mind you, every time she breaks the record she gets $30,000 so she can afford to be deliberate about it. World records aside, I thought it was a very encouraging evening\\'s work for Kelly Holmes. She looked good and was very positive. Agnes Samaria, who came second, is in very good shape and is in the world\\'s top three 800m runners this season. Yes, Samaria let Kelly get away, but there was no coming back over the last 200m as Kelly dominated the race, so beating Samaria is a bit of a benchmark for Kelly. My gut feeling is that Kelly would like to run in the European Indoor Championships, but she just hasn\\'t convinced herself she is fit enough to do so. On the other hand, I think Jason Gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the men\\'s 60m in Madrid. He started well in the final but still could not stay with the front-runners. Jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish.\\n\\nIt would have been nice to see what Mark Lewis-Francis could have done in the final, if only he hadn\\'t got himself disqualified. He was blatantly playing the false-start game to his advantage, but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly. My view is you\\'re meant to go when the gun goes and not before. And if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the false-start tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again. Having said that, Mark is looking in much better shape. But I haven\\'t seen anything from Mark or Jason yet which suggests France\\'s Ronald Pognon - who has run 6.45 seconds - will be under threat at the Europeans. From a British point of view, Sarah Claxton\\'s victory in the 60m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet.\\n\\nSomething else that probably went unnoticed was Melanie Purkiss winning the women\\'s national 400m race in a new personal best of 52.98 seconds. AAAs champion Kim Wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong 4x400m squad going to the European Championships. Scotland\\'s Lee McConnell is probably going to run too, so we have a real prospect of a medal. From an international perspective, I thought Meseret Defar was disappointing in the 3,000m, but I don\\'t think the pace-making was great. Canadian Heather Hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if Jo Pavey had been in last year\\'s shape she would have given Defar a real run for her money. She had a go but just could not hang in there. We were also expecting a bit more from Bernard Lagat in the men\\'s 1500m. But he has only just come over from the USA, so he may not be that sharp and I still think he is in great shape. As for Kenenisa Bekele, he was well beaten by Markos Geneti. But we only had half expectations for Bekele as he has been struggling this season. It was very hot in the National Indoor Arena and I felt uncomfortable in the commentary box. I think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact Defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly.\\nIAAF awaits Greek pair\\'s response\\n\\nKostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou are yet to respond to doping charges from the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).\\n\\nThe Greek pair were charged after missing a series of routine drugs tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens. They have until midnight on 16 December and an IAAF spokesman said: \"We\\'re sure their responses are on their way.\" If they do not respond or their explanations are rejected, they will be provisionally banned from competition. They will then face a hearing in front of the Greek Federation, which will ultimately determine their fate. Their former coach Christos Tzekos has also been charged with distributing banned substances. Under IAAF rules, the athletes could receive a maximum one-year suspension. Kenteris and Thanou already face a criminal trial after being charged with avoiding a drug test on the eve of the Athens Olympics and then faking a motorcyle crash.\\n\\nNo date for the trial has yet been set and again Tzekos is also facing charges. The IAAF issued an official warning to the trio last year after they were discovered training in Qatar rather than in Crete, where they had said they would be. All athletes must inform their national federations where they are at all times, so they can be available for out-of-competition drugs tests. But Kenteris and Thanou then went on to skip tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago, when they decided to fly back to Greece early. Then just before the Olympics, the pair dramatically missed another test in Athens and withdrew from the Games.\\nCollins calls for Chambers return\\n\\nWorld 100m champion Kim Collins says suspended sprinter Dwain Chambers should be allowed to compete in the Olympics again.\\n\\nChambers was banned for two years after testing positive for the anabolic steroid THG and his suspension runs out in November this year. But Collins says the British Olympic Association should reverse the decision to ban him from the Olympics for life. \"It was too harsh,\" Collins told Radio Five Live. \"They should reconsider.\" Chambers has been in America learning American football but has not ruled out a return to the track. Collins added: \"He is a great guy and I have never had any problems with him. We are friends. \"I would like to see Dwain come back and compete again. He is a good person. \"Even though he made a mistake he understands what he did and should be given a chance once more.\"\\nHolmes starts 2005 with GB events\\n\\nKelly Holmes will start 2005 with a series of races in Britain.\\n\\nHolmes will make her first track appearance on home soil since winning double Olympic gold in January\\'s Norwich Union International in Glasgow. She will also run in the Grand Prix in Birmingham in February and may defend her indoor AAA 800m title in Sheffield earlier that month. \"I am still competitive and still want to win,\" she said. \"I\\'m an athlete and I can\\'t wait to get back on the track.\" She added: \"These events are also a great opportunity to thank the British public for the enormous levels of support they have given me from the moment I stepped off that plane from Greece.\" The Glasgow meeting will see Holmes compete over 1500m in a five-way match against Sweden, France, Russia and Italy.\\nLondon hope over Chepkemei\\n\\nLondon Marathon organisers are hoping that banned athlete Susan Chepkemei will still take part in this year\\'s race on 17 April.\\n\\nChepkemei was suspended from all competition until the end of the year by Athletics Kenya after failing to report to a national training camp. \"We are watching it closely,\" said London race director David Bedford. \"There is a long way to go before the race and we are hoping the situation will be satisfactorily resolved.\" The camp in Embu was to prepare for the IAAF World Cross Country Championships later this month. Chepkemei however took part and finished third in last Sunday\\'s world best 10K race in Puerto Rico. The 29-year-old has finished second to Paula Radcliffe in the 2002 and 2003 London races as well as in November\\'s New York City marathon.\\nCampbell to extend sprint career\\n\\nDarren Campbell has set his sights on running quicker than ever after deciding not to retire from sprinting.\\n\\nCampbell, who won Olympic 4x100m relay gold, had been unsure about his future. But he told Five Live\\'s Sportsweek: \"I had to get back into training before I could decide because if I didn\\'t have the same hunger I\\'d have to walk away. \"I\\'ve started back and I\\'m thoroughly enjoying it. I\\'m looking forward to it. I\\'ve got to run under 10 seconds (for 100m) and under 20 seconds (for 200m).\" Campbell was part of the British quartet who shocked the Americans to win relay gold in Athens in August.\\n\\nThe Newport-based athlete and team-mates Jason Gardener, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis were rewarded with MBEs in the New Year Honours List. Campbell\\'s relay triumph made up for his disappointing displays in the individual 100m and 200m events in Athens, when he failed to reach the finals. The 31-year-old, who won Olympic 200m silver in Sydney in 2000, said during the Games that a hamstring injury had stopped him from running at his best.\\n\\nHe was criticised at the time by former Olympic champion Michael Johnson, who cast doubt on Campbell\\'s injury claims. \"To go to Athens and finally get the gold I\\'ve been trying to get for 24 years was a big relief,\" said Campbell. \"It was a chance for me to prove that if I\\'d been fit I would have been challenging for the (individual) medals. \"Every season I go and challenge for the medals so why would last season have been any different? \"It\\'s just unfortunate that I picked up that injury just before the Olympics.\" Campbell set his 100m personal best of 10.04secs when he won the European title in Budapest in 1998. And he ran 20.13secs in the quarter-finals of the 200m in Sydney on the way to Olympic silver.\\nUK Athletics agrees new kit deal\\n\\nUK Athletics has agreed a new deal with adidas to supply Great Britain squads of all ages with their kit for the next four years.\\n\\nThe German-based firm kitted out Team GB at the 2004 Olympics and has deals with 20 other national Olympic bodies. UK Athletics chief David Moorcroft said: \"The Athens experience can now be extended to more major championships. \"In the year ahead these include the European indoor and World outdoor championships. We are delighted.\" Moorcroft added: \"It is hugely beneficial to the sport that the adidas commitment will also provide for officials and other personnel at our world-class series of live televised events.\" This week, UK Athletics also agreed a four-year deal with energy drink company, Red Bull, who will be supplying the product to athletics at major domestic meetings and in high performance centres.\\nLewis-Francis eyeing world gold\\n\\nMark Lewis-Francis says his Olympic success has made him determined to bag World Championship 100m gold in 2005.\\n\\nThe 22-year-old pipped Maurice Greene on the last leg of the 4x100m relay in Athens to take top honours for Team GB. But individually, the Birchfield Harrier has yet to build on his World Junior Championship win four years ago. \"The gold medal in Athens has made me realise that I can get to the top level and I want to get there again. It can happen, I don\\'t see why not,\" he said. Lewis-Francis has still to decided what events will feature in his build-up to the worlds - with one exception. He has confirmed his participation in the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham on 18 February, where he will take on another member of Britain\\'s victorious men\\'s relay team - Jason Gardener - over 60m. He added: \"It\\'s a bit too early to make any predictions for Helsinki, but I have my eyes open and I know I can be the best in the world.\"\\nHansen \\'delays return until 2006\\'\\n\\nBritish triple jumper Ashia Hansen has ruled out a comeback this year after a setback in her recovery from a bad knee injury, according to reports.\\n\\nHansen, the Commonwealth and European champion, has been sidelined since the European Cup in Poland in June 2004. It was hoped she would be able to return this summer, but the wound from the injury has been very slow to heal. Her coach Aston Moore told the Times: \"We\\'re not looking at any sooner than 2006, not as a triple jumper.\" Moore said Hansen may be able to return to sprinting and long jumping sooner, but there is no short-term prospect of her being involved again in her specialist event. \"There was a problem with the wound healing and it set back her rehabilitation by about two months, but that has been solved and we can push ahead now,\" he said. \"The aim is for her to get fit as an athlete - then we will start looking at sprinting and the long jump as an introduction back to the competitive arena.\" Moore said he is confident Hansen can make it back to top-level competition, though it is unclear if that will be in time for the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne next March, when she will be 34. \"It\\'s been a frustrating time for her, but it has not fazed her determination,\" he added.\\nMcIlroy wins 800m indoor title\\n\\nJames McIlroy motored to the AAA\\'s Indoor 800m title in Sheffied on Sunday in a time of one minute, 47.97 seconds.\\n\\nThe Larne athlete dominated the race from start to finish although he had to hold off a late challenge from Welshman Jimmy Watkins in the final 100 metres. \"I had to go out and go through all the gears before the Europeans and I won\\'t run again until then,\" said McIlroy. \\'\\'I though if I got lucky I\\'d get close to the British record but I blew up in the end.\\'\\' McIlroy has been in superb form at the start of the season and will now start his build-up for the European Indoors at Madrid on 4-6 March. Meanwhile, Paul Brizzel and Anna Boyle reached the semi-finals of the 60m hurdles with Boyle setting a season\\'s best of 7.48. In the women\\'s 60m final, Ailis McSweeney broke Michelle Carroll\\'s long-standing Irish record by clocking 7.37 which left her in third place. David Gillick showed that he is a genuine medal contender in the European Indoor Championships by claiming an impressive 400m victory. Gillick was more than half-a-second clear when taking gold in 46.45 - .02 outside his personal best set in Saturday\\'s semi-finals.\\n\\nThe Irishman is now the fastest European this season. Derval O\\'Rourke broke her own Irish 60m hurdles record by clocking 8.06 which left her third behind new British record holder Sarah Claxton (7.96). James Nolan (3:46.04) took second in the men\\'s 1500m behind Neil Speaight (3:45.86) but the Offaly man was outside the European Indoor standard. Colin Costello was seventh in the 1500m final in 3:48.82). Deirdre Ryan was second in the women\\'s high jump with a clearance of 1.87m while Aoife Byrne took silver in the 800m in a personal best of 2:06.73. Lisburn\\'s Kelly McNeice Reid (4:31.34) was seventh in the women\\'s 1500m while Gary Murray (8:11.22) was 11th in the men\\'s 3000m. Meanwhile, Stephen Cairns and Jill Shannon claimed the individual titles at Saturday\\'s Northern Ireland Cross Country Championship in Coleraine. Cairns came in ahead of Paul Rowan and Allan Bogle in the men\\'s race. Willowfield claimed their first men\\'s team title in 72 years while Shannon helped Lagan Valley win the women\\'s team honours.\\nIsinbayeva heads for Birmingham\\n\\nOlympic pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva has confirmed she will take part in the 2005 Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham on 18 February.\\n\\n\"Everybody knows how much I enjoy competing in Britain. I always seem to break records there,\" said Isinbayeva. \"As Olympic champion there will be more attention on me this year, but hopefully I can respond with another record in Birmingham.\" Kelly Holmes and Carolina Kluft are among other Athens winners competing. The organisers are hoping that Isinbayeva\\'s main rival, fellow Russian Svetlana Feofanova, will also take part in the event. The pair had a thrilling battle in Athens which ended with Isinbayeva finally jumping a world record of 4.91m to claim the gold medal. Isinbayeva, 22, has set 10 world records in the pole vault, three of which have come on British soil.\\nO\\'Sullivan commits to Dublin race\\n\\nSonia O\\'Sullivan will seek to regain her title at the Bupa Great Ireland Run on 9 April in Dublin.\\n\\nThe 35-year-old was beaten into fourth at last year\\'s event, having won it a year earlier. \"I understand she\\'s had a solid winter\\'s training down in Australia after recovering from a minor injury,\" said race director Matthew Turnbull. Mark Carroll, Irish record holder at 3km, 5km and 10km, will make his debut in the mass participation 10km race. Carroll has stepped up his form in recent weeks and in late January scored an impressive 3,000m victory over leading American Alan Webb in Boston. Carroll will be facing stiff competition from Australian Craig Mottram, winner in Dublin for the last two years.\\nRadcliffe proves doubters wrong\\n\\nThis won\\'t go down as one of the greatest marathons of Paula\\'s career. But as a test of character, it was the toughest race she\\'s ever taken part in.\\n\\nA win in the New York marathon doesn\\'t make up for the disappointment of Athens in any shape or form, but it will offer hope and reassurance for next year. If Paula\\'s last experience of the year had been Athens, it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism. She can now draw a line under this year and make plans about her future. Even if she\\'d lost this race, there would have been a lot of positives to take out of it. She knows she can dig deep if she needs to. It was a strong field, with a number of the girls going into the race with expectations of winning. And although two hours 23 minutes wasn\\'t one of Paula\\'s best times, it wasn\\'t far off the record on a difficult course.\\n\\nI was speaking to Paula in the lead-up to this race and she said that in many ways she was facing a no-win situation. She thought that if she won, people would say \"why couldn\\'t she do that in Athens?\" And if she lost, people would say her career was over. And a lot of people were wondering what would happen if Paula was forced to drop out of this race, as she did in the marathon and 10,000m in Athens. But that was never on the cards. She might have been beaten, but she would have kept running. The reasons she was forced to pull out in Athens - the niggling injuries, her lack of energy and the oppressive conditions - weren\\'t at play here. The only question was what position she could finish in. Most important of all, despite all the hype in the media ahead of this race, there were never doubts in Paula\\'s mind. If she wasn\\'t confident, she wouldn\\'t have run. After all, if you\\'re the best in the world at an event, you\\'ll always have expectations of winning.\\n\\nNow Paula will take part in the Run London 10km race in London at the end of the year, have a well-earned rest over Christmas and go into next year with a lot of optimism.\\nFreeman considers return to track\\n\\nFormer Olympic champion Cathy Freeman said she would consider a return to action in the relay at next year\\'s Commonwealth Games in Melbourne.\\n\\nBut the 31-year-old said she would only try to make the team if she felt there was backing for the move. \"If there was overwhelming support for me to come back I would think about it, but not just if it was for myself,\" she told Australia\\'s Sun-Herald. \"It would be enough motivation for me to get out there and try again.\" But Freeman, who retired in July 2003, ruled out a return to the individual event. \"I don\\'t think I could ever top what I felt in Sydney, and I\\'ve got too much pride. \"If I was part of the relay I\\'d do it, but not the individual. \"The preparation and getting fit is easy. And I don\\'t think I could lose that competitiveness and killer instinct, I\\'ve just channelled it into other things.\" Former coach Raelene Boyle said the public would back Freeman were she to return to the track but questioned the wisdom of such a move. \"It would be fantastic to see Cathy run but I believe that once you retire, you retire. When you have got a unique talent like she has, maybe it would work to try again. \"But she would have to get out and prove herself in races before they selected her to run in the relay.\"\\nIAAF to rule on Greek sprint pair\\n\\nGreek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou are expected to find out on Wednesday if they will be banned for missing drugs tests this summer.\\n\\nThe International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) council held a conference call on Tuesday and are set to announce their decision. Kenteris and Thanou could be suspended for up to two years. The duo withdrew from the Olympics after missing a test but claimed they had suffered a motorcycle crash. The Greek authorities have also brought criminal charges against the sprinters for avoiding a drugs test and faking an accident. Their former coach Christos Tzekos is also facing charges and all three are awaiting a trial date.\\n\\nHowever, the IAAF will determine the sprinters\\' future on the track after carefully considering all the evidence. The sport\\'s ruling body is expected to direct the Greek federation in what action it should take against the sprinters. Kenteris and Thanou can appeal against any decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The sprinters both sent written explanations to the IAAF, which have been taken into account. The IAAF sent an official warning to the sprinters and coach Tzekos after they were discovered training in Qatar rather than in Crete, where they had said they would be. But Kenteris and Thanou then went on to skip tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago, when they decided to fly back to Greece early. Just before the Olympics, the pair dramatically missed another test in Athens before withdrawing from the Games. Kenteris, 31, won gold in the 200m at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, where Thanou, 29, won silver in the 100m.\\nCostin aims for comeback in 2006\\n\\nJamie Costin should be paralysed.\\n\\nHe says so himself in a matter-of-fact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the Olympic Stadium in Athens for the 50K Walk. There is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry, driving on the wrong side of the road, had ploughed into his rental car. \"I was in a lot of pain and I guessed that one of my toes was broken,\" says the Waterford man. \"But I was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know. \"In my back, it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but I was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully I\\'d be able to race.\" It took over 10 hours before Jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second Olympics. \"My back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae, the bottom part had exploded so I\\'m fierce lucky not be paralysed. \"I\\'d fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake.\" Jamie didn\\'t finally arrive at hospital in Athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident.\\n\\n\"For the first nine hours, I had no pain killers which was ridiculous in 35 degrees heat. \"But once I got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinking:\\'OK, I\\'ve got a different set of circumstances now\\'.\" Within three days he was arriving back in Ireland by air ambulance. Doctors in Athens had wanted to operate on Jamie\\'s back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home - something he is now very relieved about. \"The Greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae. \"That would have fused all my lower back and I would never have been able to race again. They were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery. \"But when I got to the Mater in Dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me. The people at the Mater have been absolutely fantastic.\" Jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back.\\n\\nHe then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 January. \"Walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery.\" Physio sessions with Johnston McEvoy in Limerick have been a vital part of his recovery. \"Johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and it\\'s very effective. \"Needles get put right close up to my spine. A two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and I\\'m fairly incapacitated today as a result.\" Jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the Polish training centre in Spala where he has trained with triple Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski over the past five years. \"I was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy. \"Basically, there\\'s a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus 160 degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing.\"\\n\\nJamie heads to Poland again on Sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice-daily physio sessions and pool-work. All these sessions are small steps on the way to what Jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006. \"It\\'s all about trying to get mobility in my back. Lying down for three and a half months didn\\'t really help with the strength. \"There\\'s a lot of work involved in my recovery. I\\'m doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work. \"I\\'m also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles. I\\'m fairly full on with everything I do. \"I\\'d hope to be training regularly by March. But training is just part of the process of getting back. \"At the moment, every time I go and do a big bit of movement, my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up. \"It\\'s a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts. Hopefully, after four or five months my back won\\'t tighten up as much.\"\\nIAAF will contest Greek decision\\n\\nThe International Association of Athletics Federations will appeal against the acquittal of Greek athletes Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou.\\n\\nThe high-profile duo were cleared of doping offences by the Greek Athletics Federation (Segas) last month. Now the IAAF will lodge an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and has suspended both athletes. An IAAF statement said: \"The Doping Review Board concluded that the decision is erroneous.\" The statement continued: \"Both athletes\\' cases will be refered to arbitration before the CAS. The decision in both cases will be final and binding.\"\\n\\nSegas said the IAAF appeal was \"expected\" and \"understandable.\" \"Now we are going to await the final result, which we cannot prejudge,\" said Segas chairman Vassilis Sevastis. Kenteris, who won Olympic 200m gold at the 2000 Olympics, and Thanou were suspended by the IAAF last December after failing to take routine drugs tests before the Athens Games. However, the independent tribunal overturned those bans, clearing the sprinters of avoiding tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and failing to notify anti-doping officials of their whereabouts before the Olympics.\\n\\nKenteris\\' lawyer Gregory Ioannidis described the IAAF\\'s decision as \"not unexpected\" but told BBC Sport he did not expect the organisation to take action so quickly. \"The IAAF\\'s timing is extremely surprising and it creates concerns and questions,\" said Ioannidis. \"The IAAF has not yet received the complete file of proceedings which include statements, testimonies, the closing speeches of defence counsel... and nine audio tapes.\\n\\n\"We have the evidence and it is time the world discovered the truth.\" Kenteris and Thanou dramatically withdrew from last summer\\'s Olympics after missing a drugs test at the Olympic Village on 12 August. The pair then spent four days in a hospital, claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. It was the International Olympic Committee who demanded the IAAF investigate the affair. Thanou and Kenteris still face a criminal trial later this year for allegedly avoiding the test and then faking a motorcycle accident\\nChepkemei hit by big ban\\n\\nKenya\\'s athletics body has suspended two-time London Marathon runner-up Susan Chepkemei from all competition until the end of the year.\\n\\nAthletics Kenya (AK) issued the ban after Chepkemei failed to turn up for a cross country training camp in Embu. \"We have banned her from all local and international competitions,\" said AK chief Isaiah Kiplagat. \"We shall communicate this decision to the IAAF and all meet directors all over the world.\" The 29-year-old finished second to Paula Radcliffe in the 2002 and 2003 London races, and was also edged out in an epic New York Marathon contest last year.\\n\\nBut the ban will prevent the two-time world half-marathon silver medallist from challenging Radcliffe at this year\\'s London event in April. Global Sports Communications, Chepkemei\\'s management company, said she had wanted to run in the World Cross Country Championships in March. But AK maintained it was making an example of Chepkemei as a warning to other Kenyan athletes. \"We are taking this action in order to salvage our pride,\" said Kiplagat. \"We have been accused of having no teeth to bite with and that agents are ruling over us.\" KA has also threatened three-time women\\'s short-course champion Edith Masai with a similar ban if reports that she feigned injury to avoid running at the cross country world championships are true. Masai missed the national trials in early February, but was included in the provisional team on the proviso that she ran in a regional competition. She failed to run in the event, citing a leg injury.\\nEdwards tips Idowu for Euro gold\\n\\nWorld outdoor triple jump record holder and BBC pundit Jonathan Edwards believes Phillips Idowu can take gold at the European Indoor Championships.\\n\\nIdowu landed 17.30m at the British trials in Sheffield last month to lead the world triple jump rankings. \"It\\'s all down to him, but if he jumps as well as he did in Sheffield he could win the gold medal,\" said Edwards. \"His ability is undoubted but all his best performances seem to happen in domestic meetings.\"\\n\\nIdowu made his breakthrough five years ago but so far has only a Commonwealth silver medal to his name. Edwards himself kept Idowu off top spot at the Manchester Games. But he believes the European Indoors in Madrid represent a chance for the 26-year-old to prove his credentials as Britain\\'s top triple jumper. \"He has to start producing at international level and here is the beginning,\" said Edwards. \"Phillips still needs to be much more consistent. I\\'m sure a victory in Madrid will build up his confidence and self-belief that he can be best in the world.\" The qualifying round of the men\\'s triple jump in Madrid takes place on Friday with the final scheduled for Saturday. Olympic champion Christian Olsson will not be taking part as he is out for the entire indoor season with an ankle injury.\\nEvent devised to nurture athletes\\n\\nUK Athletics has launched a new outdoor series aimed at creating extra competitive events for athletes just below Great Britain standard.\\n\\nThe UK Challenge will consist of 10 high standard meetings from May until the series final on 3 September. Athletes must compete in at least three events to gain a series ranking with the top eight athletes in each discipline contesting the final. The scheme also coincides with plans to introduce a new UK ranking system. A list of the top 100 athletes in each event will be compiled and updated every two weeks throughout the outdoor season. UK Athletics chief executive David Moorcroft said he hoped the initiatives would stimulate the sport at all levels. \"We are building on the development of domestic competition started in the indoor season and will be looking to affect the careers of thousands of British athletes,\" said Moorcroft. \"This is an athlete driven programme and identifies a strata of competitors who will provide depth to our club profile.\"\\nHolmes feted with further honour\\n\\nDouble Olympic champion Kelly Holmes has been voted European Athletics (EAA) woman athlete of 2004 in the governing body\\'s annual poll.\\n\\nThe Briton, made a dame in the New Year Honours List for taking 800m and 1,500m gold, won vital votes from the public, press and EAA member federations. She is only the second British woman to land the title after- Sally Gunnell won for her world 400m hurdles win in 1993. Swedish triple jumper Christian Olsson was voted male athlete of the year. The accolade is the latest in a long list of awards that Holmes has received since her success in Athens. In addition to becoming a dame, she was also named the BBC Sports Personality of the Year in December. Her gutsy victory in the 800m also earned her the International Association of Athletics Federations\\' award for the best women\\'s performance in the world for 2004. And she scooped two awards at the British Athletics Writers\\' Association annual dinner in October.\\nCollins banned in landmark case\\n\\nSprinter Michelle Collins has received an eight-year ban for doping offences after a hearing at the North American Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).\\n\\nAmerica\\'s former world indoor 200m champion is the first athlete to be suspended without a positive drugs test or an admission of drugs use. Collins\\' ban is a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the Balco doping scandal. The 33-year-old was found guilty of using performance-enhancing drugs. The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) decided to press charges against Collins in the summer. The sprinter has consistently protested her innocence but the CAS has upheld USADA\\'s findings. \"The USADA has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Collins took EPO, the testosterone/epitestosterone cream and THG,\" said a CAS statement. \"Collins used these substances to enhance her performance and elude the drug testing that was available at the time.\" So far a total of 13 athletes have been sanctioned for violations involving drugs associated with the Balco doping scandal. World record holder Tim Montgomery is also facing a lifetime ban after being charged by the USADA. His hearing before the CSA has been rescheduled for June next year.\\n\\nDrug enforcement chiefs in the US have vowed to crack down on cheats. USADA chief executive officer Terry Madden said the action taken against Collins was further proof of that. \"The CAS panel\\'s decision confirms that those who violate the rules will be sanctioned as part of USADA\\'s ongoing efforts to protect the rights of the overwhelming majority of US athletes that compete drug-free,\" said Madden. The USADA has built its cases on verbal evidence given to the federal investigation into Balco rather than test results. The San Francisco-based Balco laboratory faces steroid distribution and money laundering charges. The trial is expected to open next March.\\nGreek sprinters suspended by IAAF\\n\\nGreek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou have been suspended after failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics.\\n\\nAthletics\\' ruling body the IAAF said explanations from the pair and their former coach as to why they missed the tests were \"unacceptable\". It added that Kenteris and Thanou had been \"provisionally suspended pending the resolution of their cases\". They face two-year bans if found guilty by the Greek Athletics Federation. The suspension also covers the athletes\\' controversial coach, Christos Tzekos. Kenteris, the 2000 Olympic 200m champion, and Thanou, the women\\'s 100m silver medallist from the same Games in Sydney, also face a criminal hearing in Greece over the missed tests. They failed to appear to give samples in Chicago and Tel Aviv shortly before the Athens Games and again in Athens on 12 August, the eve of the opening ceremony. Greek prosecutors have also charged them with faking a midnight motorcycle crash which led to them spending four days in hospital. Some medical staff have been charged with writing false medical reports. Wednesday\\'s statement said the Greek Federation (SEGAS) would convene a disciplinary hearing for the trio to determine whether there had been doping violations.\\n\\n\"There will be a final right of appeal from the decision of the Greek Federation to the Court of Arbitration for Sport,\" the IAAF said. Tzekos insisted he and the runners had nothing to hide. \"The IAAF\\'s decision means nothing,\" he said. \"We\\'ll be presenting all our arguments to SEGAS - we\\'re innocent.\"\\nTulu to appear at Caledonian run\\n\\nTwo-time Olympic 10,000 metres champion Derartu Tulu has confirmed she will take part in the BUPA Great Caledonian Run in Edinburgh on 8 May.\\n\\nThe 32-year-old Ethiopian is the first star name to enter the event. Tulu has won the Boston, London and Tokyo Marathons, as well as the world 10,000m title in 2001. \"We are delighted to have secured the services of one the most decorated competitors the sport has ever seen,\" said race director Matthew Turnbull. \"Her record speaks for herself and there are few other women distance runners who would dare compare their pedigree with Tulu\\'s,\" he added. \"She might be 33 next month, but that didn\\'t stop her winning the Olympic 10,000m bronze medal last summer. She\\'s an ultra-consistent championships racer.\"\\nTomlinson stays focused on Europe\\n\\nLong jumper Chris Tomlinson has cut his schedule to ensure he is fully fit for the European Indoor Championships.\\n\\nThe 23-year-old has a minor injury and has pulled out of international meets in Madrid and Lievin this week as well as warm-weather training in Lanzarote. \"It\\'s nothing serious,\" said his coach Peter Stanley. \"He strained a muscle in his abdomen at the Birmingham meeting but is back in full training.\" Sprinter Mark Lewis-Francis will also not compete in Madrid on Thursday. The Birmingham athlete, who clocked a season\\'s best of 6.61 seconds over 60m in Birmingham last week, also prefers to focus his attentions on next month\\'s European Indoor Championships.\\n\\nLewis-Francis, who was runner-up to British team-mate Jason Gardener at the Europeans three years ago, will continue his training at home. Meanwhile, Tomlinson is still searching for this first major medal and this season he has shown he could be in the sort of form to grab a spot on the podium in Madrid. The Middlesbrough athlete jumped a season\\'s best of 7.95m at the Birmingham Grand Prix - good enough to push world indoor champion Savante Stringfellow into second.\\nTrial date is set for Balco case\\n\\nA US judge has set a preliminary trial date for the Balco steroid distribution case which has rocked athletics.\\n\\nUS district court judge Susan Ilston rejected an attempt by the defence team to have the case dismissed at a pre-trial hearing in San Francisco. And she set a March date for the case of the four men accused of distributing illegal performance-enhancing drugs to elite athletes to be heard. A firm decision on whether the trial takes place is expected in January. The judge said that she may conduct hearings in January into whether federal agents illegally searched the Balco headquarters and wrongfully obtained statements from the company\\'s founder Victor Conte and its vice-president James Valente. The two men - along with personal trainer Greg Anderson and athletics coach Remy Korchemny - were all indicted earlier this year but have pleaded their innocence. The outcome of those hearings could result in some or all of the charges being dismissed. Conte said that he would be telling his side of the story on an American TV show on Friday.\\n\\n\"The world deserves to know the truth about performance-enhancing drugs,\" he said. Balco (The Bay Area Laboratory Cooperative) is the company at the centre of the scandal. The company has been accused by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) of being the source of the banned steroid THG and modafinil. The USADA claims that 10 athletes have received sanctions for testing positive for THG and modafinil. Former double world champion Kelli White and Olympic relay star Alvin Harrison have both been banned on the basis of materials discovered during the Balco investigation. Britain\\'s former European 100m champion Dwain Chambers is currently serving a two-year ban after testing positive for THG in an out-of-competition test in 2003.\\nKenya lift Chepkemei\\'s suspension\\n\\nKenya\\'s athletics body has reversed a ban on marathon runner Susan Chepkemei after she made an official apology.\\n\\nAthletics Kenya (AK) had suspended the two-time London Marathon runner-up for failing to turn up to a cross-country team training camp in Embu. \"We have withdrawn the ban. Chepkemei has given a reason for her absence,\" said AK chief Isaiah Kiplagat. \"She explained she had a contract with the organisers of the race in Puerto Rice and we have accepted her apology.\"\\n\\nThe Kenyan coaching team will now decide whether Chepkemei can be included in the team for this month\\'s world cross country championships. The 29-year-old would be a strong contender at the event in France and is hopeful she will be granted a place in the 32-strong squad. \"I am satisfied that the whole saga has been brought to an end,\" Chepkemei said. \"I am ready and prepared to represent my country. \"I will be disappointed if I am not given a chance to compete at the world cross country championships.\" AK had insisted it was making an example of Chepkemei by banning her from competition until the end of 2005. But the organisation came under intense international and domestic pressure to reverse its decision. The 29-year-old took part in the 2002 and 2003 London Marathons and was edged out by Radcliffe in an epic New York Marathon contest last year.\\n\\nThe two-time world half-marathon silver medallist will be back to challenge Radcliffe at this year\\'s London event in April. AK also dropped its harsh stance on three-time world cross country 4km champion Edith Masai. Masai missed Kenya\\'s world cross country trials because of an ankle problem but AK insisted it would take disciplinary action unless she could prove she was really injured. \"Subject to our doctor\\'s confirmation, we have decided to clear Masai,\" added Kiplagat.\\nRadcliffe tackles marathon tasks\\n\\nPaula Radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the New York City Marathon on Sunday.\\n\\nBack under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the Athens Olympics, where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10,000m. BBC Sport examines the challenges facing Radcliffe ahead of the big race. \\n\\nThe ability to run a gruelling 26.2 miles relies largely upon an athlete\\'s belief that they can do it. Every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it, \"Are you strong enough to finish?\"\\n\\nThe question could hit Radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances. Sports psychologist Hugh Richards says the 30-year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence. \"There is an old adage, \\'get straight back on the horse that threw you,\\'\" Richards told BBC Sport. \"Paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in Athens. \"She must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running. \"If she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness. \"She wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment.\" \\n\\nFor much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in New York - win or lose. If Radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong. But if she fails to triumph, she risks being labelled a has-been and her profile will suffer. And for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship, appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues.\\n\\n\"Athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions,\" explains Richards, who has worked with past Olympians. \"She must not get caught up in someone else\\'s agenda.\" Radcliffe\\'s best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling revealed the 30-year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in New York. \"She just thought, \\'well, they can\\'t think any worse of me now,\\'\" Yelling told BBC Sport. \"She\\'s just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it.\" \\n\\nRadcliffe described her decision to enter the New York marathon as \"impulsive\" but she is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals. Her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but Richards says she must avoid more emotional targets, such as redemption. \"You can\\'t change history,\" warned Richards. \"Only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful. \"Paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race.\" \\n\\nThe course from Staten Island to Central Park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world. It is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit Radcliffe better, with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs\\' final reserves.\\n\\nRadcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the Athens marathon. \"It\\'s suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again,\" said Yelling, herself a marathon runner. \"But that is only for long-term health and fitness. \"When you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly. So physically it is possible for Paula.\" Richards also points out conditions in New York will be more conducive to a strong physical display from Radcliffe. \"The heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in Athens,\" he said. \"And that just isn\\'t going to be there in New York, that\\'s been taken out of the equation.\" \\n\\n\\n\\nRadcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in Athens in time. And Richards and Yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage, starting in New York. \"How you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not,\" argues Richards.\\n\\n\"One of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities.\" And Yelling says: \"I think this will probably make Paula.\" \"I think it will drive her on and she\\'ll come out of it a better athlete.\"\\nCollins to compete in Birmingham\\n\\nWorld and Commonwealth 100m champion Kim Collins will compete in the 60m at the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham on 18 February.\\n\\nThe St Kitts and Nevis star joins British Olympic relay gold medallists Jason Gardener and Mark Lewis-Francis. Sydney Olympic 100m champion and world indoor record holder Maurice Greene and Athens Olympic 100m silver medallist Francis Obikwelu will also take part. Collins ran in Birmingham at the 2003 World Indoor Championships. \"I\\'m looking forward to competing against such a strong field,\" he said. \"I got a great reception form the crowd at the NIA when I won my 60m world indoor silver medal in 2003 and it will be really exciting to return to this venue.\" The world champion says he\\'s in good shape but he isn\\'t underestimating the home competition. \"Jason Gardener and Mark Lewis-Francis are Olympic gold medallists now and I\\'m sure they\\'ll be aiming to win in front of their home supporters. \"I\\'m looking forward to competing against Britain\\'s best sprinters and I\\'m sure the 60 metres will be one of the most exciting races of the evening.\" Collins was sixth in the Olympic final in Athens but is hoping for a better result at the World Championships in Finland this summer. \"This will be a big year for me and I plan to defend my 100m world title in Helsinki in August. Before then I want to perform well over 60m indoors and start my year in winning form.\"\\n2004: An Irish Athletics Year\\n\\n2004 won\\'t be remembered as one of Irish athletics\\' great years.\\n\\nThe year began with that optimism which invariably and unaccountably, seems to herald an upcoming Olympiad. But come late August, a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in Athens told us of the true strength of Irish athletics - or to be more accurate, the lack of it. Sonia O\\'Sullivan\\'s Olympic farewell apart, there was little to stir the emotions of Irish athletics watchers. But after the disastrous build-up to the games, we shouldn\\'t have been surprised. At the start of the year, an O\\'Sullivan had been earmarked as Ireland\\'s best medal prospect but as it turned out, walker Gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury. Less than a week before the Olympics, the sport was rocked by news that 10,000m hope Cathal Lombard had tested for the banned substance EPO. Lombard\\'s shattering of Mark Carroll\\'s national 10,000m record in April had already set tongues wagging but even the most cynical of observers, were surprised when he was rumbled after an Irish Sports Council sting operation. The Corkman quickly held his hands up in admission and was promptly handed a two-year ban from the sport.\\n\\nBack at pre-Olympic ranch in Greece, it must have seemed that things couldn\\'t have got any worse but they very nearly did with walker Jamie Costin lucky to escape with his life after being involved in a car crash near Athens. Once the track and field action began in Athens, a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although Alistair Cragg\\'s performance in being the only athlete from a European nation to qualify for the 5,000m final did offer hope for the future. Our beloved Sonia scraped into the women\\'s 5K final as a fastest loser and for a couple of days, the country attempted to delude itself into believing that she might be in the medal shake-up. As it happened, she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over a minute behind winner Meseret Defar. It later transpired that Sonia had been suffering from a stomach bug in the 48 hours before the final although typically, the Cobhwoman played down the effects of the illness. Amazingly, she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a world-class field at the Flora Lite 5K road race in London and while her major championship days may be over, it\\'s unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition. At least Sonia managed to make it to Athens. At the start of the year, several Northern Ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the Games but come August, an out-of-form and injured Paul Brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province. The Ballymena man gave it a lash but his achilles problem, and a bad lane draw, meant a time of 21.00 and an early exit.\\n\\nJames McIlroy, Gareth Turnbull, Zoe Brown and Paul McKee all had to be content with watching the Athens action on their television screens. 800m hope McIlroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the British trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane. The injury-plagued Turnbull gamely travelled round Europe in search of the 1500m qualifying mark but 3:39 was the best he could achieve, after missing several months training during the previous winter. A lingering hamstring probem and a virus wrecked McKee\\'s Athens ambitions and both he and Turnbull deserve a slice of better fortune in 2005. Pole vaulter Brown had hoped for a vote of confidence from the British selectors after she had achieved the Athens B standard but the call never came. As the summer ended, stalwarts Catherina McKiernan and Dermot Donnelly hung up their competitive spikes. McKiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on her after several injury-ravaged years. Donnelly and his Annadale Striders team-mates later suffered tragedy when their friend and clubman Andy Campbell was found dead at his home on 18 December. A large turnout of athletics-loving folk turned out in west Belfast to offer their respects to the Campbell family and Andy\\'s many friends. As only death can, it put the year\\'s athletics happenings in a sharp perspective.\\nBrizzel to run AAA\\'s in Sheffield\\n\\nBallymena sprinter Paul Brizzel will be among eight of Ireland\\'s European Indoor hopefuls competing in this weekend\\'s AAA\\'s Championships.\\n\\nUS-based Alistair Cragg and Mark Carroll are the only Irish athletes selected so far for the Europeans who will not run in Sheffield. Brizzel will defend his 200m title in the British trials. In-form James McIlroy will hope to confirm his place in the British team for Madrid by winning the 800m title. McIlroy has been in tremendous form on the European circuit in recent weeks. He is one of the fastest 800m runners in the world this winter and already seems assured of a place in Madrid. Corkman Mark Carroll confirmed in midweek that he would join Cragg in the European Championships. Carroll is ranked number three in the world 3000m ranking at the moment with Cragg occupying top spot. Meanwhile, nine-times champion Dermot Donnelly will not be coming out of retirement to compete in the Northern Ireland Cross Country Championships in Coleraine on Saturday. An injury crisis in the Annadale Striders squad led to Donnelly being entered by coach John McLaughlin but the athlete told BBC Sport on Friday evening that he would not be running. Willowfield\\'s Paul Rowan will go in as individual favourite but Annadale could have a tough job holding on to their team title as Andrew Dunwoody and Noel Pollock are unlikely to run.\\nKluft playing down record chance\\n\\nSweden\\'s Carolina Kluft fears Jackie Joyner-Kersee\\'s world record heptathlon points total of 7291 set at the 1988 Olympics may never be surpassed.\\n\\nThe Olympic champion, who set her best of 7001 to win the 2003 world title, begins her 2005 season at the Reebok Indoor Games in Boston on Saturday. \"Her record is probably unbeatable,\" said Kluft. \"I will try to do my best to be as good as I can. \"How far I can go? I have no idea. But she\\'s got a great record.\" Kluft, American Joyner-Kersee and Russia\\'s Larisa Nikitina are the only woman to have broken the 7000 points barrier. Meanwhile, last year\\'s world indoor champion is determined to add gold at the European Indoor Championships to her collection, with the meeting held in Madrid in March. \"It\\'s a good experience to compete outside of Sweden and outside of Europe,\" said Kluft. \"It\\'s going to be a great competition here in Boston, a great preparation for the European Indoors Championships.\"\\nKaif shines in India win\\n\\nFirst one-day international, Chittagong: India 245-8 (50 overs) v Bangladesh 234-8 (50 overs) by 11 runs\\n\\nMohammad Kaif (80) and Rahul Dravid (53) shared a stand of 128 as the tourists posted a total of 245-8. Skipper Habibul Bashar kept Bangladesh in the hunt with 65, but his departure left them with too much to do. Khaled Mashud hit an unbeaten 50 but Sridharan Sriram took 3-43 as the home side were restricted to 234-8. After winning the Test series 2-0, India took the opportunity to rest batsman Virender Sehwag and fast bowler Zaheer Khan and give debuts to wicket-keeper Mahendra Dhoni and seamer Joginder Sharma. But skipper Sourav Ganguly lost the toss and opposite number Bashar\\'s decision to put them in paid off initially as India were reduced to 45-3. Ganguly was bowled for nought by the second ball of the match from Tapash Baisya and 17-year-old Nazmul Hossain then claimed the prized scalp of Sachin Tendulkar, who was caught behind for 19.\\n\\nMushfiqur Rahman trapped Yuvraj Singh lbw for 21, but Kaif and Dravid steadied the innings and Bangladesh had to wait 28 overs for their next success. Both batsmen reached their half centuries off 74 balls, but Dravid edged a catch to the keeper off Khaled Mahmud soon after and Sriram was stumped for three off spinner Mohammad Rafique. Dhoni\\'s first innings for India lasted one delivery as he was run out for nought and when Kaif gave a return catch to Nazmul in the 47th over, the total had only just passed 200. But Ajit Agarkar made 25 and Irfan Pathan hit two sixes in his 21 not out off 11 balls, runs which ultimately made all the difference.\\n\\nBangladesh were soon in trouble in reply as Rafique (eight), Nafis Iqbal (nine) and Mohammad Ashraful (two) all failed - the latter becoming Sharma\\'s first international victim when he was caught by Ganguly. Bashar and Aftab Ahmed put on 64 in 14 overs before both fell victim to Sriram\\'s left-arm spin, along with Rajin Saleh (14), as the home side slumped from 108-3 to 156-6. Mushfique was lbw to Agarkar for two but Mashud and Mahmud did their best to revive their side, adding 40 for the eighth wicket in six overs. The target was out of reach, however, and Mahmud perished for 21 to a catch by Man of the Match Kaif as Bangladesh\\'s hopes were finally extinguished. Mashud had the consolation of reaching his fifth one-day half century before Baisya drove the final ball of the game to extra cover for four, but it was too late for Bangladesh.\\n\\nNafis Iqbal, Habibul Bashar (Capt), Mohammad Ashraful Aftab Ahmed, Khaled Mashud (Wkt), Mushfiqur Rahman, Khaled Mahmud Manjural Islam Rana, Mohammad Rafique, Tapash Baisya Nazmul Hossain.\\n\\nS Sriram, S R Tendulkar, S C Ganguly (Capt), R Dravid Yuvraj Singh, M Kaif, M S Dhoni (Wkt), I K Pathan, Harbhajan Singh J Sharma, A B Agarkar.\\n\\nAleem Dar and Mahbubur Rahman\\nHayden sets up Australia win\\n\\nSecond one-day international, Christchurch Australia 314-6 (50 overs) beat New Zealand 208 (40.4 overs) by 106 runs\\n\\nRicky Ponting (53) and Damien Martyn (58) provided the main support for Hayden, who hit two sixes and 12 fours. They eventually totalled 314-6 and the game was as good as over when New Zealand slumped to 73-6 in reply, with Adam Gilchrist taking five catches. Daniel Vettori made a rapid 83 but they were all out for 208 in the 41st over. New Zealand must now win all three remaining matches to take the series, but such a turn-round looked a remote possibility at Jade Stadium. Skipepr Stephen Fleming chose to put Australia in after winning the toss, with former rugby star Jeff Wilson included in the New Zealand team for his first one-day international since March 1993. He was taught a harsh lesson as his six overs cost 57 runs, with only left-arm spinner Vettori (0-31 from 10) able to exercise any measure of control over the Australian batsmen.\\n\\nGilchrist was caught behind off Daryl Tuffey from the second ball of the match but Hayden and Ponting set about putting things right with a stand of 99 for the second wicket. Ponting cleared the ropes twice as he raced to 50 off 51 balls, but only added three more before he was run out by Hamish Marshall. By then, Hayden was into his stride and he and Martyn added 133, although it took them 24 overs. Martyn was run out off the final ball of the 41st over, but the final nine cost the Kiwis 82 runs as Australia raised the tempo. Hayden\\'s century came up off 110 balls but he eventually fell to a catch by Wilson off Kyle Mills, leaving Michael Clarke to add 23 off 13 balls and Mike Hussey 32 not out off 20 as the total mounted past 300.\\n\\nThe new ball pairing of Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath made short work of New Zealand\\'s top order, claiming two wickets each - all of them catches behind the wicket by Gilchrist. He claimed another when Andrew Symonds found the edge of Craig McMillan\\'s bat and when Chris Cairns followed for 22, caught by Hayden, the home side were in danger of being embarrassed. Vettori and Brendon McCullum (20) halted their decline by sharing a stand of 62 before McCullum gave a return catch to Symonds, who finished with 3-41. Wilson made 22 in an eighth wicket stand of 62 but the end came quickly once he was caught by Ponting off Jason Gillespie. Having passed fifty for the first time in a limited overs international, Vettori was denied a century when he was caught at deep square leg off Gillespie after hitting 10 fours in his 77-ball knock. Mills was last to go, run out by Clarke, after setting off for a quick single and being sent back by Tuffey.\\n\\nS P Fleming, N J Astle, M S Sinclair, J Wilson, C D McMillan, H J H Marshall, C L Cairns, B B McCullum, K D Mills, D L Vettori, D R Tuffey\\n\\nM L Hayden, A C Gilchrist, R T Ponting, D R Martyn, A Symonds, M J Clarke, M E K Hussey, G B Hogg, B Lee, J Gillespie, G D McGrath\\nIndia clear for Chittagong games\\n\\nIndian cricket officials have given clearance for the national team to play in Chittagong during their tour to Bangladesh, which began on Wednesday.\\n\\nThe team received alleged death threats from a radical Muslim group. But the foreign ministry were satisfied with security arrangements in Dhaka, where the first Test begins on Friday. And the team have now given the green light for the games scheduled for Chittagong, which will stage the second Test and first one-day international. \"We have now received assessment of the Indian security team that went to Chittagong. \"They made a full assessment of the security arrangements, in consultation with the Bangladesh authorities. \"On the basis of security team\\'s report, the government is advising BCCI to go ahead with the matches in Chittagong,\" said foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna.\\n\\nThe inspection covered the venue, hotel and other areas where the Indian cricket team will be present. Specific recommendations for tightening security arrangements and these have been accepted by the Bangladesh authorities. A letter, apparently from a previously unknown Islamic group Harkat-ul-Jihad, arrived at the Indian embassy last Thursday. It threatened to kill the players in revenge for the riots in Gujarat in India three years ago which left many Muslims dead. However, the Bangladesh high commission said the threats were a hoax. Explosions and other attacks are not uncommon in Bangladesh - more than 20 people were killed when grenades were thrown at an opposition rally in August. There have also been blasts at cinemas. Few arrests have been made, but Islamic extremists are widely blamed. Indian cricketers have visited Bangladesh several times, most recently in 2003 for a triangular tournament that also involved South Africa.\\nAustralia dominate India\\n\\nThird Test, Nagpur, day two (stumps):\\nAustralia 398 v India 146-5\\n\\nThe home side closed on 146-5, 252 runs in arrears and still 53 short of avoiding the follow-on. Glenn McGrath, playing in his 100th Test, took 2-18 in 20 overs as Mohammad Kaif (47 not out) propped up an innings that crawled at two runs per over. Australia were earlier dismissed for 398, with Michael Clarke falling to Zaheer Khan (4-95) nine short of a ton. India did not take long in wrapping up Australia\\'s innings at the start of the day, claiming the three remaining overnight wickets for 36 runs. Jason Gillespie, lbw to Zaheer, and Kasprowicz, bowled by Agit Agarkar, both fell cheaply, leaving McGrath as Clarke\\'s last hope of a second Test century. The veteran enjoyed his stay at the crease with two hooked boundaries, and in the end it was he who remained unbeaten when Clarke edged behind to end an entertaining knock that included 13 boundaries.\\n\\nIndia were given a typically blustery start by Virender Sehwag, who took four boundaries off Gillespie\\'s first over. It forced skipper Adam Gilchrist to protect the boundary with a sweeper after just five overs, but having forced Australia on the defensive Sehwag soon gave his wicket away. Flashing hard at McGrath, the opener became the Aussie paceman\\'s 447th victim when edging into the gloves of the athletic Gilchrist, diving high to his right. Gillespie, belted out of the attack by Sehwag, returned from the other end and struck immediately to have Aakash Chopra caught by Warne at slip for eight.\\n\\nIt left India 35-2 at lunch, and a very quiet period followed the interval as Rahul Dravid and the returning Sachin Tendulkar tried to block India to parity. The pair put on 15 runs in one ball shy of 13 dawdling overs before Tendulkar was trapped in front of stumps by Gillespie (2-47) for eight. The grassy Nagpur pitch meant Shane Warne\\'s introduction was delayed until the 36th over, but two balls were all it took for the Test cricket\\'s leading wicket-taker to add to his tally. In having VVS Laxman caught by Clarke in gully, Warne ousted him for the third time this series and reduced India to a perilous 75-4 in the process. Dravid\\'s stay at the crease was a lengthy one but largely unproductive, and after consuming 140 balls for 21 runs he edged McGrath to slip. It was a predictable end after the veteran paceman had worked India\\'s stand-in skipper over with an array of balls which leapt off the seam on a pitch more akin to Australian grounds.\\n\\nAt 103-5 India looked vulnerable, but Kaif and Parthiv Patel - fresh from their century stand in the second Test - showed heart in the fading light. It was not plain sailing for Kaif - a spurned run-out chance and a catch off a no-ball offered two reprieves - but he grew into his task and even managed a six off Warne over long-off. Although India\\'s sixth wicket offered the home side hope, Australia were in a strong position to push for the victory that would award them a first series victory in India for 35 years.\\n\\nA Chopra, V Sehwag, R Dravid (Capt), S R Tendulkar V V S Laxman, M Kaif, P A Patel (Wkt), A B Agarkar, A Kumble M Kartik, Z Khan.\\n\\nM L Hayden, J L Langer, S M Katich, D R Martyn D S Lehmann, M J Clarke, A C Gilchrist (Capt, Wkt), S K Warne M S Kasprowicz, J N Gillespie, G D McGrath.\\n\\nAleem Dar, D R Shepherd.\\nSri Lanka cancel tour\\n\\nSri Lanka have cancelled their cricket tour of New Zealand following the tsunami disaster that has ravaged the country, it has been confirmed.\\n\\nThe tour had been put on hold after the first one-day international game was played on 26 December, the same day the tidal wave struck the island country. Sri Lanka Cricket initially said it would postpone the tour but on Wednesday decided to pull out. \"We fully understand the decision,\" said ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed. The latest death toll for Sri Lankans caught up in the disaster stands at 22,000. A statement from Sri Lanka Cricket stated: \"The Sri Lankan cricketers have always stood by the people of this country in good times and bad times. \"The cancellation of this tour will enable the cricketers to help the board assist victims of the disaster.\" Speed said: \"The impact of the tsunami on Sri Lanka has been devastating. \"In this situation where two of our members have agreed to postpone the series there is no issue of fines or compensation. \"The Sri Lankan players will now be able to return to their families and the series will be replayed at a date in the future to be confirmed.\" The tour, comprising one-day internationals and Test matches, will now be rescheduled by both cricket boards by mutual agreement.\\n\\nNone of the Sri Lanka squad lost family members in the disaster, but the mothers of Sanath Jayasuriya and Upul Chandana are believed to have been injured. Star spin bowler Muttiah Muralitharan, meanwhile, came within minutes of being caught up in the huge tidal waves which swept across the Sri Lankan coastline at Galle. \"I missed the wave by 20 minutes. I had only just left Galle so I am very lucky to be alive,\" he said, having had to miss the early part of the tour due to injury. New Zealand Cricket chief executive Martin Snedden said: \"We will now give the Sri Lankan cricket team every assistance to return home as soon as possible. \"As the magnitude of the recent events in Sri Lanka has unfolded it has become more difficult for the Sri Lankan team to remain in New Zealand.\"\\nEngland pondering line-up\\n\\nFirst one-day international, Johannesburg South Africa v England\\n\\nPlay starts Sunday, 0800 GMT\\n\\nIan Bell, Kevin Pietersen and Kabir Ali all performed so well in the warm-up win over South Africa A as to give captain Michael Vaughan some dilemmas. Vaughan admired Pietersen\\'s 97 off 84 balls on Thursday. He said: \"The players are still talking about his innings so it must have been special. \"You certainly want any guy who can clear the ropes in your team.\" Vaughan, set to bat at four with Pietersen a spot lower in the order, added: \"Kevin is a character, someone who is very confident and doesn\\'t mind having a word. I like that. \"But Sunday\\'s a big selection to make because Ian Bell and Pietersen played so well in Kimberley, and Kabir Ali bowled well. \"We will have a few new players on Sunday and it will be a big opportunity for them to try to establish themselves in the team. \"It will also be a great experience for them as we build for the World Cup in a couple of years time.\"\\n\\nBell anchored England\\'s win in Kimberley with an accomplished unbeaten 87. His best chance of playing would perhaps be to dislodge Vikram Solanki and provide Marcus Trescothick with a new opening partner. But England have shown long-term patience with Solanki even though he has almost always been inconsistent. Kabir, who took 4-40 on Thursday, features in a squad rich in seam bowlers, with Matthew Hoggard and Simon Jones both rested for the warm-up. Vaughan predicted the seven-match one-day series would be tightly contested, even though South Africa have fallen to seventh in the ICC rankings. \"It\\'s going to be tough because they\\'re a good team, especially at home, who bat very deep. They\\'ve got so many all-rounders. \"But their record is not so great in the last year, so that\\'s something for us to aim at.\"\\n\\nSouth Africa captain Graeme Smith defended his team\\'s recent record, despite the fact they have won just two of their last 13 one-day internationals. He said: \"It\\'s been difficult, but we\\'ve been playing a lot in the sub-continent. In our own conditions we\\'ve got a good record in one-day cricket.\" The captain confirmed he would open the batting with Herschelle Gibbs. Smith said his team were \"not too fussed\" about the probable inclusion in the England team of batsman Kevin Pietersen, who was born in KwaZulu-Natal. \"He enjoys the attention, but we will just have to knock him over early,\" said Smith. \"It will be easier to have him sitting in the changing-room and then we will not get banned if we abuse him.\"\\n\\nM Vaughan (capt), Kabir Ali, J Anderson, G Batty, I Bell, P Collingwood, A Giles, D Gough, S Harmison, M Hoggard, G Jones (wkt), S Jones, K Pietersen, V Solanki, A Strauss, M Trescothick, A Wharf.\\n\\nG Smith (capt), A Bacher, N Boje, M Boucher (wkt), AB de Villiers, H Gibbs, A Hall, J Kallis, J Kemp, C Langeveldt, A Nel, M Ntini, A Prince, S Pollock, J Rudolph.\\nSouth Africa back in contention\\n\\nFirst Test, Port Elizabeth, day three (stumps): South Africa 337 & 99-2 v England 425\\n\\nEngland, who resumed play on 227-1, were bowled out for 425 after losing three wickets for 29 runs and four for 12 in two separate mini-collapses. Makhaya Ntini took three wickets in four balls before returning 3-75. South Africa then lost AB de Villiers and Jacques Rudolph before closing on 99-2, a lead of 11 runs. The hosts emerged for the day\\'s play with renewed zeal after their listless display in the field on Saturday. Andrew Strauss could add only six to his overnight score of 120 before cutting Shaun Pollock on the up and picking out de Villiers at point.\\n\\nMichael Vaughan, fresh from his run-hungry deeds against Zimbabwe and South Africa A, broadcast his levels of confidence with a six over third man off Andrew Hall. But it was to prove a false dawn as two balls later the England captain dallied outside the off-stump to a fuller delivery and was caught at slip. Graham Thorpe was unimpressive in 45 minutes in the middle, scoring just four before being bowled around his legs sweeping at Graeme Smith\\'s amateur off-breaks.\\n\\nAlthough three strikes in the morning was a good return for the hosts, Butcher was keeping the score ticking over with an array of pulled and cut boundaries, and they were doing themselves no favours by continually no-balling. In the entire innings, South Africa conceded a national record 57 extras, including 35 no-balls. Debutant Dale Steyn was the chief culprit, overstepping 16 times. Butcher and Andrew Flintoff built a promising 79-run stand either side of lunch, and the former\\'s 12th boundary midway through the afternoon took the recovering visitors into the lead. Ntini, unthreatening to this point, then turned the game on its head with three wickets in four balls to orchestrate a one-time familiar middle-order collapse. Butcher\\'s demise - a faint edge through to impressive keeper Thami Tsolekile - was a soft way to end a 23rd Test fifty that looked like becoming his ninth ton.\\n\\nIf his departure was unthinking, Flintoff\\'s was plain mindless. The powerful all-rounder had ridden a difficult period to move to 35, but threw his wicket away when despatching a deliberate short ball down the throat of Rudolph at deep square. Geraint Jones misread the sluggishness of the pitch to be caught at short extra cover next ball, and though Matthew Hoggard kept out the hat-trick ball he soon fell to Hall for a duck to reduce his team to 358-8. Ashley Giles emphasized his worth down the order with a brisk 26, putting on 36 with Simon Jones before edging Pollock to slip. Another 31 runs were added for the final wicket, during which time Steve Harmison was dropped twice and caught off a Steyn no-ball.\\n\\nSteyn kept his foot behind the popping crease to eventually get rid of Jones for 24 and end England\\'s first innings. Hoggard, so industrious with the ball in the first innings, again served his team well when snatching a wonderful, low-down catch off his own bowling to remove de Villiers for 14. A sizeable first-innings deficit still hung over the hosts on 26-1, but with Hoggard seemingly straining his side and Harmison (0-29 off six overs) way off colour England did not fully cash in. It took the introduction of Giles to oust Rudolph (caught at slip) for a nicely crafted 29, but Smith (33) and Jacques Kallis (10) comfortably saw South Africa out of the red and to the safety of stumps. The day belonged to the home side, but they will need to repeat the dose on Monday to ensure they cannot be beaten in the series\\' opener.\\n\\nG Smith (captain), AB de Villiers, J Rudolph, J Kallis, B Dippenaar, Z de Bruyn, A Hall, S Pollock, T Tsolekile (wk), M Ntini, D Steyn.\\n\\nM Vaughan (captain), M Trescothick, A Strauss, M Butcher, G Thorpe, A Flintoff, G Jones (wk), A Giles, S Jones, M Hoggard, S Harmison.\\nPakistan batsmen make edgy start\\n\\nTour match, Dharamsala, day one (stumps) Pakistan 165-5 v Indian Board President\\'s XI\\n\\nAt stumps on day one of three, the tourists were 165-5 in Dharamsala, with only 45 overs possible because of rain. There was an important 72-run stand for the fifth wicket between Inzamam-ul-Haq and Asim Kamal after Pakistan had collapsed from 54-0 to 83-4. Kamal was still there at the close on 43 after captain Inzamam, on his 35th birthday, was dismissed for 35. Pakistan had been cruising early on through Salman Butt and Taufeeq Umar before losing four wickets for 29 runs in barely 10 overs of cricket. In the 11th over a misunderstanding with Umar about a second run resulted in his downfall - Gagandeep Singh hitting the stumps with a throw from fine leg. Gagandeep then did his job with the ball as Younis Khan was caught at second slip for a two-ball duck. Yousuf Youhana batted brightly but after hitting 18 off as many deliveries he fell soon after tea inside-edging a drive off Shib Paul to wicket-keeper Parthiv Patel. And moments later Umar was held at short midwicket off bat and pad to give Rudra Singh a wicket. With the pressure on, Inzamam and Kamal produced a dogged effort in the final session before venugopal Rao trapped the skipper lbw. It was the only wicket to fall to a spinner during the course of a chilly day in this city in the foothills of the Himalayas. The match is Pakistan\\'s only warm-up game before the first of three Tests against India begins in Mohali on 8 March.\\n\\nMohammad Kaif (capt), Dheeraj Jadhav, Satyajit Parab, Venugopala Rao, Suresh Raina, Parthiv Patel (wkt), Ramesh Powar, Gagandeep Singh, Shib Shankar Paul, Rudra Pratap Singh, Neeraj Patel.\\n\\nInzamam-ul-Haq (capt), Salman Butt, Taufeeq Umar, Yousuf Youhana, Younis Khan, Asim Kamal, Abdul Razzaq, Kamran Akmal (wkt), Danish Kaneria, Mohammad Sami, Rana Naved-ul-Hasan.\\nLee runs through Windies\\n\\nVB Series match 6, Adelaide: Australia 269-8 beat West Indies 196 by 73 runs\\n\\nPaceman Pedro Collins took his first one-day five-wicket haul but Australia wriggled out of trouble to post a healthy 269-8 in Adelaide. Then paceman Brett Lee twice took wickets off consecutive deliveries for figures of 4-38 as West Indies folded for 196 in the 45th over. Collins (5-43) removed four top-order batsmen before the Aussies recovered. Simon Katich\\'s 76 off 86 balls began the fightback. But the turning-point really came when Jason Gillespie (44) and Brett Lee (38) put on 73 runs, unbroken, for the ninth wicket in less than 12 overs. Gillespie, who scored his maiden Test fifty this Australian summer, registered his highest one-day score off just 42 balls, striking two fours and a six.\\n\\nKatich and Gillespie were two of three changes to the Aussie side, with Brad Hogg joining them at the expense of Shane Watson, Michael Kasprowicz and Damien Martyn. The West Indies stuck with the side that nearly beat Australia last Friday in Brisbane until rain stopped play. Collins struck twice in the third over after the home side had won the toss under a hot and humid sky on Australia Day. The left-armer had out-of-sorts opener Matthew Hayden caught behind off a bottom edge before ousting skipper Ricky Ponting (caught) for a duck to reduce them to 24-2. Michael Clarke blasted his way to 21 off 15 balls before he misjudged a drive and was clean bowled by Collins, and Darren Lehmann perished in the paceman\\'s next over to a catch behind the stumps. Andrew Symonds, promoted to number four after five ducks from his previous six digs, helped Australia recover from 38-4 but was caught behind off Wavell Hinds for 31 off 49 balls.\\n\\nThe Windies were on top with the middle-order exposed, but Katich and Brad Haddin made sure they failed to push home the advantage. The pair put on 82 in 14 overs before Haddin was bowled by Dwayne Bravo (2-71), but it was not until Lee and Gillespie were brought together by Collins\\' removal of Katich in the 39th over that Australia really got on top. Losing both openers inside the first 13 balls of their reply, West Indies were never in control of their run chase. Lee struck with the last ball of his first over and the first ball of his second thanks to catches behind the wicket by Haddin, the second one a brilliant one-handed take. Ramanaresh Sarwan and Shivnarine Chanderpaul then added 92 for the third wicket in 22 overs. But Sarwan feathered an edge off Hogg before a brilliant direct hit from Clarke ran out Chanderpaul for 55.\\n\\nThe momentum had gone and the wickets tumbled as Marlon Samuels drilled Lehmann to extra cover, Brian Lara gave Lee a catch off his own bowling and Courtney Browne fell lbw to the same bowler. Gillespie mopped up the tail as West Indies left the Adelaide Oval still hunting their first win after four VB Series matches. Afterwards, Lee said: \"I always try to make sure that I\\'m fully fit so that if I get the opportunity I can give my best and hopefully I\\'ve done that. \"I\\'ve done a lot of bowling in the nets with my training partner Andrew Symonds, working on different balls. \"I\\'ve felt that with every game I\\'ve got a bit better.\"\\n\\nRicky Ponting, Matthew Hayden, Michael Clarke, Darren Lehmann, Andrew Symonds, Simon Katich, Brad Haddin, Brad Hogg, Brett Lee, Jason Gillespie, Glenn McGrath.\\n\\nBrian Lara, Chris Gayle, Wavell Hinds, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Marlon Samuels, Dwayne Bravo, Courtney Browne, Ian Bradshaw, Mervyn Dillon, Pedro Collins\\nSouth Africa recall spinner Boje\\n\\nSouth Africa have recalled spinner Nicky Boje for the first Test against England, which begins on 17 December.\\n\\nBoje missed the recent tour of India because of fears he would be called in for questioning by Indian police over match-fixing allegations. Pace bowler Dale Steyn and opening batsmen AB de Villiers are new faces in a 13-man squad. Despite suffering poor form in India, new wicket-keeper Thami Tsolekile has been preferred to Mark Boucher. There is no place for opener Herschelle Gibbs, who has been struggling with a finger injury after missing the India trip, and spin all-rounder Justin Ontong has been dropped. Nicky Boje, who underwent minor surgery to remove a growth in his neck, will have to pass a fitness test before the match.

Club spokesman Keith Cook told BBC Sport: \"We had an e-mail from Heath overnight via his agent in which he states that he wants to co-ordinate his international commitments with Warwickshire and incorporate our views into his thinking.\" In theory there would be no major conflict of interests this summer as Zimbabwe\\'s tour to South Africa ends in mid-March and they are not in action again until September, when they play host to New Zealand. But Streak\\'s situation will be discussed by the Warwickshire committee at a meeting on Monday. Following Streak\\'s sacking by Zimbabwe, 14 players resigned in protest but Gavin Ewing, Barney Rogers and Andy Blignaut have also returned to the fold and more could follow suit. ZC say they are in negotiations with the remaining \\'rebels\\', but it is believed that Grant Flower (Essex) and Ray Price (Worcestershire) are unlikely to sign deals after committing themselves to playing county cricket in England next season.\\nYouhana leads from front\\n\\nSecond Test, Melbourne, day one (close): Pakistan 318-6 v Australia\\n\\nStand-in captain Yousuf Youhana led the way in Melbourne, smashing a superb ton and putting on 192 with Younis Khan. But the Australians hit back late when Youhana missed a Shane Warne full toss and was stumped for 111. Jason Gillespie, the pick of the bowlers with 3-72, then ousted Younis and Shoaib Malik in quick succession. Younis was caught behind by Adam Gilchrist off Gillespie\\'s first delivery with the second new ball for 87.\\n\\nAnd the paceman struck again in his next over when Malik was caught at slip by Ricky Ponting for seven, Pakistan losing three wickets for just 15 runs. Abdul Razzaq was not out on one and Kamran Akmal unbeaten on 16 at the close of play. Earlier, Salman Butt hit his maiden Test half-century as he put on 85 for the first wicket with Imran Farhat.\\n\\nMichael Kasprowicz claimed the only wicket to fall before lunch when he had Farhat brilliantly caught by Ponting at slip for 20. But the hosts struck straight after the interval when Yasir Hameed was trapped leg before by Gillespie for two. Butt\\'s brave knock came to an end when he was run out by a superb throw from Michael Clarke going for a second run. The opener had made 70 and his dismissal left Pakistan struggling on 94-3. but Youhana, filling in as captain for the injured Inzamam-ul-Haq, and Younis steadied the ship. Australia, who were lifted before the start of play by news that in-form opener Justin Langer was fit enough to take his place in the side, won the first Test in Perth by 491 runs. Overall, Pakistan have only won four times in 27 Tests played in Australia, although two of those successes came at the MCG.\\n\\nJ L Langer, M L Hayden, R T Ponting (capt), D R Martyn D S Lehmann, M J Clarke, A C Gilchrist (wkt), S K Warne J N Gillespie, M S Kasprowicz, G D McGrath.\\n\\nSalman Butt, Imran Farhat, Younis Khan Yousuf Youhana (Capt), Yasir Hameed, Shoaib Malik, Abdul Razzaq Kamran Akmal (Wkt), Mohammad Sami, Shoaib Akhtar, Danish Kaneria.\\n\\nR E Koertzen and J W Lloyds\\nEngland on brink of defeat\\n\\nTour match, Potchefstroom, day three of three (rain): England 225 & 190 v South Africa A 281 & 101-3\\n\\nAfter Martin van Jaarsveld was removed for a duck in the first over, Andrew Puttick made 45 with seven fours. But he and Justin Ontong, who hit four fours in 23, fell in consecutive overs after a break for lightning, and with 34 needed to win, heavy rain arrived. England were dismissed for 190, adding 36, Michael Vaughan ninth out after two more fours and a six en route to 100. With the home side moving serenely at 70-1, faint hopes of an escape for England arrived in the form of a violent clap of thunder, which took the players off the field. Lightning struck a field next to the ground, but there was no rain and play resumed within 10 minutes. It did have a beneficial effect for the tourists as two wickets fell within six balls.\\n\\nPuttick was caught behind and Ontong hooked Steve Harmison to the fine-leg boundary, where Ashley Giles took an impressive running catch to his left. Vaughan began the day on 82 not out, his team 98 ahead with three wickets intact. He signalled his intentions in the very first over with a four through mid-on and a six over long-on from the spin of Ontong. Hopes of a long partnership with county colleague Matthew Hoggard were ended in the fourth over of the morning when the seamer was caught at second slip, having failed to add to his overnight three. Having pulled Charl Willoughby through mid-wicket for four and clipped him away to reach three figures, Vaughan chased a wide one from the left-armer end edged to keeper Mark Boucher. He spent 226 minutes at the crease and faced 151 balls.\\n\\nME Trescothick, MP Vaughan (Capt), AJ Strauss, MA Butcher, GP Thorpe, A Flintoff, GO Jones (Wkt), AF Giles, SP Jones, SJ Harmison, MJ Hoggard.\\n\\nAshwell Prince (Capt), Justin Ontong, Mark Boucher (Wkt), JP Duminy, Charl Langeveldt, Ethy Mbhalati, Albie Morkel, Andrew Puttick, Alfonso Thomas, Martin van Jaarsveld, Charl Willoughby.\\nKiwis recall Tuffey for Sri Lanka\\n\\nNew Zealand have recalled seam bowler Daryl Tuffey to their squad for their one-day series with Sri Lanka.\\n\\nTuffey, who missed the recent tours of Bangladesh and Australia with a leg injury, is fully fit according to Kiwis\\' coach John Bracewell.

The ground is 1,300 feet above sea level but Pakistan do not expect conditions to be a problem. \"We have played in Johannesburg, so altitude is not an issue,\" team manager Salim Altaf commented. Pakistan have a number of selection issues, but paln to field the same XI which plays against the President\\'s XI in the first Test. Salman Butt, Yasir Hameed and Taufeeq Umar appear to be competing for two places at the top of the order. And there may only be room for two seamers from Mohammad Sami, Naved-ul-Hasan and Mohammad Khalil if Danish Kaneria and Arshad Khan are chosen to form a spin bowling partnership in Mohali. \"We expect pitches to turn in India and our players will have to learn to adapt themselves, but we have a talented batting line-up. We have a good team in the making,\" said coach Bob Woolmer. \"We have an effective spinner in Kaneria, who can become one of the best leg-spinners in world cricket. He has the potential as he is a different type of leg-spinner.\" The match is Pakistan\\'s only warm-up before the start of the Test series but it could be disrupted by the weather. Tuesday\\'s practice session was cancelled because of rain and further downpours are forecast until the weekend. Woolmer, has, meanwhile, been trying to take some of the pressure off his players ahead of the Tests. \"Cricket is a game.

New Zealand lost by 86 runs as Australia wrapped up the series with two matches remaining. Lance Hamilton replaces Tuffey for the fourth ODI in Wellington on Tuesday. Kiwi captain Stephen Fleming said he was disappointed with Tuffey\\'s performance at Eden Park. \"There was a lot of faith put in him for this game,\" he told the Sunday Star-Times. \"There were question marks over his form from the first two games and that performance was certainly not up to international standard. \"You have got to be pretty disappointed when he bowled so well for us in the past and then he puts in a performance like that.\" Michael Papps, who was twice hit on the head by Brett Lee bouncers on Saturday, will also be missing although a scan revealed he had avoided serious injury.

The revenue gained was to fund a development looking to improve the standard of the US national team, which was beaten heavily by New Zealand and Australia in September. The letter, signed by ICC president Ehsan Mani and chief executive Malcolm Speed, was addressed to USACA president Gladstone Dainty. It went on: \"We have been copied with numerous letters to and from you that indicate that USACA has plunged into further disarray. \"Further, we have witnessed the abysmal performance of the USA cricket team at the ICC Champions Trophy.\" \"We have now been approached by other countries that would like to replace USA as the preferred partner of ICC to deliver international cricket matches.\"\\n\\nThe USACA has until 1 February to sign a memorandum of understanding over Project USA, with the ICC threatening to move it to another country otherwise. Among other second-tier nations, the Netherlands staged a rain-hit one-day series involving Australia, Pakistan and India last August. Morocco and the United Arab Emirates are both non-Test-playing nations that have successfully hosted international matches in the past. The number of cricketers in the US has grown massively over the past decade to over 16,000 and is now larger than anywhere outside the 10 Test-playing countries. It is estimated there are over five million US immigrants from cricket-playing countries as a potential audience for pay-per-view television. Mani made a US expansion one of his key aims when he came to office, but plans to stage matches in the 2007 World Cup there were abandoned because of logistical difficulties. An ICC spokesman told BBC Sport: \"The letter was not seeking to influence domestic governance - it was simply expressing a view.\"\\nAshes defeat \\'won\\'t hurt Aussies\\'\\n\\nAustralia great Rodney Marsh says it would do his country no harm if they were to return from England in September having lost the Ashes.\\n\\n\"In the big picture, England need to be strong,\" said Marsh, who steps down as director of England\\'s national academy in September. \"So, it won\\'t do Australia or the game any harm if they lose the Ashes. \"If people back home cannot understand that, that\\'s tough,\" he told the Daily Telegraph newspaper. Marsh flew out on Wednesday to Dubai as coach of the England A team for their tour of the United Arab Emirates and Sri Lanka. He has been employed by the England and Wales Cricket Board as academy director since 2001, and subsequently as a selector. \"By the time I leave the ECB, I would like to think I had played a small part in making England more competitive, though the players are the ones who have done the work,\" he said. Australia have won the past eight Ashes series and are the world\\'s top-ranked team. The five-Test Ashes series begins at Lord\\'s on 21 July.\\nShoaib ruled out of Test series\\n\\nFast bowler Shoaib Akhtar will miss Pakistan\\'s Test series in India because he is still troubled by a hamstring injury and cannot be considered.\\n\\nHe suffered the injury in Australia last month and says his recovery will take another four to five weeks. The squad for India will be named on Saturday but he was quoted as saying: \"I don\\'t want to play half fit.\" The news comes less than 24 hours after he was fined £265 for breaching the terms of his contract in Australia. He was accused of visiting nightclubs and talking to the media without permission, but denies the charges and has lodged an appeal against the decision of a disciplinary panel. However, Shoaib insisted his decision to pull out of the Test series had nothing to do with the outcome of the disciplinary hearing. \"My decision is not linked to the fine or warning,\" he said. \"It is an honest decision since I don\\'t want to go half fit to India.\" Shoaib\\'s absence will be a huge blow to Pakistan\\'s chances of avenging last year\\'s home Test series defeat by India. But he still hopes to be available for the six one-day internationals which follow the Test matches. \"I have informed the Pakistan Cricket Board of my decision and will inform them as soon as I get fit so if the team needs me at that stage I am available.\\n\\n\"I would love to play the one-day series provided the team needs me,\" he added. The 29-year-old, known as the Rawalpindi Express, is the quickest bowler in world cricket and has been clocked at 100mph. But his fitness record has been poor and he has missed 30 of the 66 Tests Pakistan have played since he made his debut in November 1997. Shoaib believes injuries are an inevitable part of the game for fast bowlers because of the amount of international cricket nowadays. But critics point to the fact that he has increased his workload by agreeing contracts with English counties. He had spells with Durham in 2003-04 and is due to play for Worcestershire in the second half of the 2005 season following a tour to the West Indies. Pakistan, meanwhile, are awaiting fitness reports on fellow seamers Mohammad Sami, Mohammad Khalil and Shabbir Ahmed before finalising their squad for India. Another paceman, Umar Gul, will definitely not make the trip because he is still undergoing rehabilitation following stress fractures in his back.\\nICC ponders one-day alterations\\n\\nThe rules of one-day cricket could be changed to allow the fielding side to take two wickets off a single ball.\\n\\nA striking batsman could be dismissed lbw or caught and his partner run out. The International Cricket Council is also considering an idea to modify the 15-over period of fielding restrictions normally set for an innings start. Instead, the batting side would choose three different slots of five overs when only two fielders would be permitted to cover the boundaries. Sunil Gavaskar heads the ICC committee which has recommended the proposal in a bid to inject interest into the one-day game which the former India captain says has become \"predictable\". \"We\\'ve looked at a double play situation,\" he explained in an interview with the Melbourne Age. \"If a batsman\\'s been given out lbw and the ball ricochets off to gully and the fielder picks it up and throws at the non-striker\\'s end, so you have two dismissals off one ball. \"Same if the ball\\'s gone up in the air.\" The ICC is discussing the proposals at a meeting in Melbourne.\\nJayasuriya set to join Somerset\\n\\nSomerset are expected to announce later on Thursday that Sri Lankan batsman Sanath Jayasuriya will join the county for the start of the 2005 season.\\n\\nChief executive Peter Anderson told BBC Sport that the club would release a statement on the matter at 1600 GMT. Jayasuriya will probably fill the place of Graeme Smith on a temporary basis as the South African is due to arrive in late May to captain the team.

Only those punished for level three or four offences have the opportunity to contest. \"If they are going to impose the maximum fine they must allow an appeal procedure,\" Bevan continued. \"We will be calling the ICC and if we don\\'t receive some common sense we will consider legal action under European Laws.\" Vaughan made the comments after umpires Steve Bucknor and Aleem Dar ended the second day because of bad light, even though Vaughan, who was at the crease at the time, wanted to go on.\\n\\n\"The ICC expect players to promote the game and talk to TV and the media and all Michael did was answer some questions honestly,\" Bevan explained. \"He did not swear or abuse anyone, he politely suggested there had been some in consistent umpiring. He certainly did not bring cricket into disrepute. \"It strikes me the umpires have had a poor Test both on and off the field all match.\" Bevan was due to meet the ECB on Monday to get their backing.\\nEngland \\'could win Ashes\\'\\n\\nFormer England stalwart Alec Stewart believes Michael Vaughan\\'s team is capable of beating Australia next year.\\n\\nEngland last held the Ashes in 1987 but have won eight Tests in a row in the past year and Stewart said: \"They\\'re going from strength to strength. \"We\\'ve got to remember that Australia are the best side, there is still a gap between us but we\\'ve certainly closed that gap from when we last played them. \"If we can maintain form and fitness and in home conditions you never know.\" Having opened the innings many times at Test level for England, Stewart is hugely impressed by the impact made by Andrew Strauss. \"It\\'s been incredible,\" he enthused. \"When you start in international cricket there\\'s always that slight question mark in the back of your mind but he hasn\\'t looked out of his depth at any stage. \"Now when he comes to the wicket he\\'s full of confidence.\"\\n\\nStewart also feels that South Africa have problems, both on and off the field, as they bid to come from 1-0 down in the five-match series. \"I played over there twice and they were always tough to play against, but they didn\\'t look like the South Africa of old,\" he said. \"They are not picking their best side, without a doubt I\\'d make sure Mark Boucher comes back in, he\\'s a world class cricketer. England move to Durban on Wednesday to prepare for the second Test, which begins on Boxing Day.\\n\\n\"England didn\\'t allow them to play at their best,\" Stewart said of the first Test, which the tourists won by seven wickets. \"England have to play as they have and keep improving, Michael Vaughan will be driving that home to the players. \"At the start of the series I thought there would only be one Test in it but now I think we can win by more than that.\"\\nMurali to miss one-dayers in NZ\\n\\nSri Lanka have put back plans to take spinner Muttiah Muralitharan on the one-day leg of their New Zealand tour.\\n\\nMuralitharan was to have travelled with the team as part of his rehabilitation from shoulder surgery but now needs to prove his fitness before joining them. He will aim to play in a practice match in Sri Lanka on 27 December, two weeks before the first Test in Auckland. The off spinner resumed bowling last week and is currently bowling 24 balls every other day in the nets. Sri Lanka begin their tour of New Zealand on 21 December, playing two Tests and five one-day internationals. Surgeon David Young operated on Muralitharan in August to treat a lesion which had caused a build-up of fluid around the nerves in his right shoulder. At the time of his injury, Muralitharan held the world record of 532 Test wickets, which has since been surpassed by Australia\\'s Shane Warne.\\nPakistan on revenge mission\\n\\nPakistan\\'s cricketers depart for Delhi on Monday with captain Inzamam-ul-Haq beseeching his side to make up for the 2004 defeat to India on home soil.\\n\\nIndia outplayed Pakistan 12 months ago, beating them 2-1 in the Tests and 3-2 in the one-day internationals. Inzamam said ahead of Pakistan\\'s first full tour of India for six years: \"We want to make amends for last year. \"The Australian tour was a big learning experience and I think we are in a position to reap benefits in India.\" Series between India and Pakistan are always eagerly awaited, largely because politics often restrict the amount of cricket the two teams can play against each other. This particular engagement, which will include three Tests and six one-dayers, was twice threatened. The schedule has already been put back four days over a dispute which centred on Pakistan\\'s refusal to play the second Test in Ahmedabad.\\n\\nThe first Test in Mohali will now get under way on 8 March. Then, following a protracted row over television rights, the Madras High Court issued interim orders to ensure the matches would be broadcast live by state=owned channel Doordarshan. After the 2004 series between the two sides, Pakistan sacked their coach Javed Miandad. Inzamam believes his replacement, Bob Woolmer, has improved the side even if a string of positive results have not yet come. He said: \"A lot has changed since that series. Woolmer has helped change the attitude of the boys which is more positive and professional and I think they can take the pressure of playing in India.\" Pakistan will be without strike bowler Shoaib Akhtar (hamstring), leaving recalled off-spinner Arshad Khan and leg-spinner Danish Kaneria with much work to do. Inzamam said: \"Shoaib\\'s absence will be felt. But our strength is playing as a unit. \"[Khan and Kaneria] have a big role to play in India. They are the ones on whom we will be depending a lot in the Test matches. \"We are expecting slow, turning tracks and we have been practicing for such conditions.\" Pakistan\\'s first match is a three-day warm-up against the Indian Board President\\'s XI in Dharamsala from March 3.\\n\\nSalman Butt, Yasir Hameed, Taufeeq Umar, Younis Khan, Inzamam-ul-Haq (captain), Yousuf Youhana, Asim Kamal, Kamran Akmal (wkt), Abdul Razzaq, Shoaib Malik, Shahid Afridi, Arshad Khan, Danish Kaneria, Muhammad Sami, Rana Naved, Muhammad Khalil.\\nHodge earns Aussie Test call\\n\\nAustralia have named prolific batsman Brad Hodge in their 13-man squad for the Test series in New Zealand.\\n\\nThe 30-year-old Victorian went on the tour to India last year but has yet to play a Test despite consistent performances in domestic cricket. Veteran batsman Darren Lehmann needs shoulder surgery and misses out, as does all-rounder Shane Watson who has just recovered from a torn side muscle. The first of three Tests will be in Christchurch from 10-14 March. Hodge only played one warm-up match on the tour of India but heavy scoring in recent weeks for Victoria has earned him the nod ahead of Mike Hussey and Andrew Symonds.\\n\\nChairman of selectors Trevor Hohns said: \"He has presented an irresistible case to be part of this tour and if he gets the opportunity, we feel confident that he can do a good job for Australia. \"We said during the Indian series, when he missed out on a spot in the Test XI, that he was still in line for national selection. His domestic form has ensured that this is the case.\" Hohns says the small size of the squad will not pose problems for the tourists, most of whom are already in New Zealand, where they have won the first four one-day internationals.\\n\\nOpening batsman Justin Langer and leg-spinner Shane Warne will join up with them on Monday 7 March. \"We feel that this is a balanced squad and don\\'t believe we have to extend the size of the touring party beyond 13 players,\" Hohns added. \"We have plenty of options with both bat and ball and, given the close proximity of the two countries, we always have the option of flying players in as the series progresses.\" Pace bowler Brett Lee is hoping to play his first Test since January last year after impressing in the one-day game. But Hohns hinted he faces a tough task to displace Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie or Michael Kasprowicz, who took a combined total of 149 Test wickets in 2004. \"Everyone\\'s been singing their praises during that period and you only have to look at their results. \"There\\'s not too many sides who\\'ve scored many runs against that three-pronged attack.\"\\n\\nRicky Ponting (capt), Adam Gilchrist, Michael Clarke, Jason Gillespie, Matthew Hayden, Brad Hodge, Michael Kasprowicz, Simon Katich, Justin Langer, Brett Lee, Damien Martyn, Glenn McGrath, Shane Warne.\\nSri Lanka decide to continue tour\\n\\nSri Lanka are to continue their cricket tour to New Zealand after a five-day period of mourning for those killed by the tidal waves in south Asia.\\n\\nThe death toll is now at around 23,000, almost half of them Sri Lankans, and many more are still missing. \"Cricket is not the thing on our minds at the moment,\" said team manager Brendon Kuruppu. Wednesday\\'s game in Napier has been postponed but the Sri Lankan board decided the tour should go on. The one-day series will now resume on 2 January in Queenstown. The match in Napier will now be played on 11 January and the Test series, which was due to begin on the 15th, will also be rescheduled. \"New Zealand Cricket has great compassion for the people of Sri Lanka and what they have suffered during this terrible time,\" said NZC chief executive Martin Snedden. \"It is testament to the strong relationship between the two boards that they have worked together to quickly find a workable solution.\" John Bracewell, coach of the New Zealand team, said his players had been deeply moved by the disaster and their thoughts were with the Sri Lankan squad. \"It\\'s a shock to everyone and our sympathies do go out to them,\" he said. \"I\\'ve no doubt our guys will talk to their guys about it. It\\'s pretty rough.\" The Sri Lanka under-19 team\\'s tour to Pakistan has been postponed. \"We can understand that in their current state of affairs they are in no position to play a cricket series,\" said Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan. The Indian and Australian women\\'s teams will, however, play a one-day match in Madras as planned on Tuesday.\\nBangladesh build platform\\n\\nFirst Test, Chittagong, day two (stumps): Bangladesh 488 v Zimbabwe 84-4\\n\\nThey began by extending their overnight 280-4 by 208 in just over two sessions, for their highest Test total of 488. Rajin Saleh led the way with 89 and Mohammad Rafique hit four sixes in his 69, sharing stands of 69 and 62 with Khaled Mashud and Mashrafe bin Mortaza. Zimbabwe then lost four wickets inside 21 overs before a slight recovery. The home side had only passed 400 twice previously in 34 Tests, scoring 400 against India in their inaugural match in 2000 and 416 in the West Indies last year. They suffered an early setback when Aftab Ahmed was lbw to Christopher Mpofu for six in the third over of play.\\n\\nBut Saleh, who was 60 not out overnight, progressed to his best score in Tests before departing with the total on 341. Mashud\\'s innings was sedate in tempo, taking up 120 balls and featuring only six boundaries, and he was denied a half century when he became 18-year-old Graeme Cremer\\'s first Test victim. Leg-spinner Cremer found the edge and Mluleki Nkala, the sole slip fielder, made no mistake. Mashud\\'s departure signalled an end to the niceties as Rafique and Mortaza tore into tiring bowlers.\\n\\nIn contrast to the opening session in which only 66 runs were scored, the duo went along at six an over before Rafique was caught behind off Mpofu. But Mortaza struck eight fours as he went past his previous best of 29, reaching 40 not out at tea. Mpofu bowled Tapash Baisya for six in the first over following the re-start, but Mortaza responded by hoisting Matsikenyeri over mid-wicket for six. The innings finally came to an end when Mortaza, on 48, cut a ball from Cremer into the hands of Vusi Sibanda at backward point. Mpofu finished with 4-109 for the Zimbabweans in his debut Test appearance. Matsikenyeri got Zimbabwe off to a fluent start, with five fours in his 28 from 30 balls before he was caught at slip in the eighth over. Vusimuzi Sibanda scored all of his 12 runs in boundaries before he was trapped by Mohammad Rafique, the left-arm spinner also snaring Cremer third ball for a duck. Opener Barney Rogers was more watchful, taking 28 deliveries to open his account, but he was run out at the non-striker\\'s end when Enamul Haque diverted a ball onto the stumps. Hamilton Masakadza remained undefeated, with four fours in his 28, sharing an unbroken 25 with Brendon Taylor who hit two fours in his eight not out, as three boundaries came in the final two overs.\\n\\nHabibul Bashar (captain), Khaled Mashud, Nafis Iqbal, Javed Omar, Mohammed Ashraful, Rajin Saleh, Aftab Ahmed, Mohammed Rafique, Enamul Haque, Tapash Baishya and Mashrafe bin Mortaza.\\n\\nTatenda Taibu (captain), Elton Chigumbura, Stuart Matsikenyeri, Barney Rogers, Vusimuzi Sibanda, Hamilton Masakadza, Brendan Taylor, Graeme Cremer, Christopher Mpofu, Douglas Hondo, Mluleki Nkala.

He has starred for South Africa in the series with England, averaging 60.85 with the bat, but knows he has a job to do with his side 2-1 down heading into the final Test in Pretoria. \"We\\'re under a lot more pressure than England, but we\\'re determined to draw the series,\" Kallis told BBC Sport Wales. \"England did it to us in the final Test of the last series between the sides, now it\\'s our turn to come out and win the game. \"Losing the last Test was very frustrating. The batting let us down, to get bowled out in two sessions on that type of wicket was not good enough. \"We\\'d played good cricket until then and felt we\\'d had the chance to win the game.\" Despite his desire to return to county cricket in the future, Kallis admitted that the demands of the international game were taking its toll and called for a reassessment of the fixture calendar. He is keen to carry on with his bowling, though, and still sees his future as an all-rounder. \"I enjoy my bowling,\" he said, \"I\\'ve worked hard on it and hope to keep it going for a few years yet.\"\\nIndia\\'s top six secure - Ganguly\\n\\nCaptain Sourav Ganguly has revealed India will not be tempted into tinkering with their batting order for the first Test against Pakistan.\\n\\n\"Our batting order for the Tests is fixed. There are no changes from number three to six,\" Ganguly told BBC Sport. It means Rahul Dravid will remain at number three and VVS Laxman at six, despite the latter averaging 53.5 at first drop in Test cricket. \"To be honest, Dravid has batted better than Laxman at three,\" Ganguly added. \"If you ask any batsman, he would like to bat higher up, as it gives a greater opportunity to score. \"While batting lower down the order, you have to play more with the tail.\" Ganguly gave his backing to Gautam Gambhir, banishing speculation Yuvraj Singh could be asked to open the batting again after a failed experiment against Australia last year.\\n\\n\"I feel there is no born opener - the team has to find one,\" he stated. \"Look at Justin Langer, he was not an opener, but how well the Aussies have groomed him. Virender Sehwag is a settled opener now both in Tests and one-dayers, and Gambhir is doing well. \"In a year\\'s time, we should have a settled opening pair.\" Sachin Tendulkar, who will bat at number four with Ganguly at five, also received the support of his skipper despite concerns over fitness and form. \"When Sachin says he is 100 percent fit, he is, and nobody has a right to talk about the form of a man who has 70 international hundreds.\" With wicket-keeper Dinesh Karthik to come in at number seven, India are left with just four spots for bowlers - suggesting Yuvraj could miss out.\\n\\nMohali, which will host the first Test starting on 8 March, is known as a seam-friendly pitch and India have included four pacemen in their 14-man squad. In addition to spinners Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh, India will be forced to choose from the pace quartet of Irfan Pathan, Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra and Lakshmipathy Balaji. \"In Kumble and Harbhajan, we have two world class spinners and at the moment there is no place for a third one,\" Ganguly said. \"Our seam attack had done particularly well during the Pakistan tour last year, and we will select the final eleven after having a look at the wickets in Mohali, which has had a record of a seaming track.\" Ganguly refused to get carried away with the fact Pakistan\\'s pace attack has been depleted with the absence of Shoaib Akhtar through injury.\\n\\n\"I feel Pakistan has a young and fit team, which is hungry for success. In my view they have done the right thing by bringing a fit team, rather than bringing injured players,\" he said. \"It is better to have a fully fit team than having an injured Shoaib Akhtar or even Don Bradman for that matter. \"I do not agree with those who say Pakistan\\'s team is weak and has given India a walkover. \"It will be a tough series and the next 50 days will be a treat for fans of both sides.\"\\nIndia \\'confident\\' of deal\\n\\nThe president of the Indian board has insisted the home series against Pakistan will go ahead despite an ongoing legal wrangle over TV rights.\\n\\n\"We are confident something will be worked out. As soon as we hear from the courts, we will work on a war footing,\" said Ranbir Singh Mahendra. Zee TV, who are challenging the board\\'s decision to scrap a £241m right deal, have offered a compromise. They have offered to screen the series as a one-off. In a letter to the board, they wrote: \"ZTL would do this entirely at its risks and costs and without any equity in its favour. \"This shall also be without prejudice to the respective contentions of the parties before the Madras Court.\" Zee say they would only require to be paid \"mutually agreed\" production costs. The Pakistan Cricket Board, meanwhile, has expressed concern about earlier news reports that the series could be postponed again until the court case is resolved. Such a move would be \"highly disappointing\" as fans in both countries are \"eagerly awaiting the series\", read a PCB statement. \"It would also lead to a severe loss of revenue for both boards and dislocation in logistics for a postponed tour.\\n\\n\"Moreover, a further postponement of the tour would be difficult because Pakistan will be touring the West Indies in early May,\" the statement continued. The Pakistan squad is due to arrive in India on Monday to play three Tests and six one-day internationals. The tour has already been postponed once while the two boards revised the itinerary after Pakistan refused to play a Test in Ahmedabad because of security concerns. Losing the series would be a massive blow to the prestige of Mahendra, who replaced Jagmohan Dalmiya as BCCI president last September. But he told the Agence France Presse: \"The tour will go ahead as scheduled. \"Yes, there has been a delay on TV rights, but that is because the matter is in court.\" Zee was awarded a four-year contract last year but the Board tried to reopen the bidding process after ESPN-Star Sports and Rupert Murdoch\\'s News Corporation challenged the original decision. ESPN and Indian state broadcaster Doordarshan are also talking to the Board in an attempt to ensure the series goes ahead.\\nEngland claim historic series win\\n\\nFifth Test, Centurion, day five: South Africa 247 & 296-6d drew with England 359 & 73-4\\n\\nEngland win five-match series 2-1\\n\\nCenturies from Jacques Kallis and AB de Villiers allowed South Africa to declare on 296-6, setting England a target of 185 to win from 44 overs. The tourists chose not to chase the runs, however, finishing on 73-4. There were plenty of nervous moments when they lost early wickets but captain Michael Vaughan held firm to secure a 2-1 series triumph. Though the usually brilliant Andrew Strauss scored a duck, only Denis Compton had ever scored more runs in a series against South Africa and he won the man-of-the-series award for his three centuries. Kallis and man-of-the-match de Villiers were in occupation of the crease when the day started, with South Africa still trailing by 53 runs. By the time they had been parted, they had added 227 for the third wicket. The scoring rate was never sensational, however, as Vaughan declined to set over-attacking fields and the batsman refused to take undue risks.\\n\\nIt took more than an hour for the lead to be wiped off, as De Villiers hit arguably the shot of the day - a pull off Matthew Hoggard that went all the way for six. The remaining hour-and-a-half of an extended morning session saw a further 100 runs added. The two right-handers were quick to pull and drive when the opportunities presented themselves. Kallis was twice lucky to survive. At one point he edged Hoggard inches short of Marcus Trescothick at slip and then, on 76, looked lucky to survive an lbw appeal against Simon Jones. De Villiers reached his half-century with a square drive off Ashley Giles for four, and he continued to play the spinner with great certainty. In the afternoon session, it was widely assumed South Africa would throw the bat at almost everything. First, however, both batsmen needed to reach their centuries.\\n\\nKallis got there first, cutting Jones for four - it was his fifth Test ton against England and 20th in all. The 20-year-old de Villiers became the third youngest South African to hit a Test century with a boundary in the same area off the same bowler. But he then perished when holing out to third man off Jones. He had made 109 off 169 balls. Oddly, Kallis took stock for a while before launching a few more boundaries shortly before the declaration, finally finishing unbeaten on 136. In the hunt for quick runs, Graeme Smith, Jacques Rudolph and Mark Boucher all perished for single figure scores. A grateful Steve Harmison took his first two wickets since Cape Town and Hoggard added a single victim to finish with 26 in the series. Set 185 from 44 overs, England were never in position to go for the target once Strauss had been caught behind in Ntini\\'s first over.\\n\\nThings looked dicey when Robert Key provided just 40 minutes of uncertain resistance before edging Pollock to Boucher. And there were certainly a few skipped heartbeats in the England dressing-room when Trescothick inexplicably missed a straight ball from Ntini to be bowled. That left 29 overs remaining for South Africa to try to find the last seven wickets. Vaughan and Graham Thorpe, however, proved adept at blunting some impressive spells from all the bowlers until Ntini returned to have Thorpe caught by Herschelle Gibbs who was close in at third slip. England had just about done enough by then and the game ended in bad light two-and-half overs early with Vaughan 26 not out and Andrew Flintoff unbeaten on 14. It was England\\'s first series win in South Africa since MJK Smith led them to a 1-0 win in 1964-65. And it earned them the Basil D\\'Oliveira Trophy, named after the player who the South African apartheid regime refused to allow to tour their country with England in 1968, ultimately resulting in their exclusion from international sport.\\n\\nGraeme Smith (capt.), Herschelle Gibbs, Jacques Rudolph, Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers, Mark Boucher (wkt), Andrew Hall, Nicky Boje, Shaun Pollock, Makhaya Ntini, Andre Nel.\\n\\nMarcus Trescothick, Andrew Strauss, Robert Key, Michael Vaughan (capt.), Graham Thorpe, Andrew Flintoff, Geraint Jones (wkt), Ashley Giles, Matthew Hoggard, Steve Harmison, Simon Jones.\\n\\nSA Bucknor (WI), Aleem Dar (Pkn)\\nPietersen gives England a chance\\n\\nLunch: England 240 all out (49.5 overs)\\n\\nHis innings of 116 came after the rest of the batsmen had failed dismally to be 68-6 at the mid-innings point.

It won\\'t be done in a couple of days - it will take months, maybe years. \"We just need to help them in whatever way we can,\" vice-captain Mahela Jayawardene said. Sri Lanka played only one of a series of five one-day internationals in New Zealand and two Test matches were also called off. The tour will be rescheduled at a time to be agreed by the two boards.\\n\\n\"The general feeling with everyone is that this was the right thing to do. Cricket is just not important at the moment,\" said team manager Brendon Kuruppu. \"No-one has been thinking about cricket. The players have just been staying in their hotel rooms watching everything on television and trying to phone home to get information.\"\\n\\nStar spin bowler Muttiah Muralitharan came within minutes of being caught up in the huge tidal waves which swept across the Sri Lankan coastline at Galle. He is still recuperating from shoulder surgery. \"I missed the wave by 20 minutes. I had only just left Galle so I am very luck to be alive,\" he told the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper. New Zealand Cricket, meanwhile, have agreed to allow the World Vision charity to raise funds through their website. They also plan to donate NZ$1 (£0.37) for every ticket sold for their Twenty20 match against Australia on 17 February to the disaster appeal. The Kiwi players will also be donating signed shirts they wear for the game in Auckland for auction.\\nBashar delighted after series win\\n\\nBangladesh skipper Habibul Bashar was thrilled after the win in the decider against Zimbabwe gave his country their first-ever one-day series triumph.\\n\\n\"Yes, our morale was down after losing the first two matches,\" he said, after the eight-wicket victory in Dhaka. \"But we knew we could come back and win the series. \"We worked hard and tried to rectify our mistakes and I am happy to have won the match chasing a target, which was not easy.\" Taibu\\'s counterpart, Tatenda Taibu, was left to reflect on what might have been after losing the early initiative in the five-match series.\\n\\n\"It was so near and yet so far for us,\" said the Zimbabwe captain. \"I think we did not play spin well enough and lost wickets at crucial stages. They played well, but I think our boys did a good job. We worked hard and fought it out.\" Bangladesh have won only nine of their 106 matches since making their one-day debut in 1986 and clinched their maiden Test series against Zimbabwe earlier in January.\\nRichardson ends just short\\n\\nNew Zealand batsman Mark Richardson bowed out of from all forms of cricket at the age of 33 just short of 10,000 first-class runs.\\n\\nRichardson needed 41 runs for Auckland against Canterbury to reach the milestone, but finished on 9,994. He made 35 in his side\\'s first innings but did not bat again when Auckland won by an innings and 60 runs. Opener Richardson only made his debut in 2000 but played in 38 Tests, scoring 2776 runs at an average of 44.77. But after impressing against England, making a century at Lord\\'s, he has struggled of late, with just 48 runs in two Test defeats in Australia. He announced his retirement last week, saying: \"I feel I left something out on the park at Lord\\'s and have lost the drive to play the Richardson way. \"I\\'m hanging my boots up for good. Since last year\\'s South African series I\\'ve started to struggle with the game emotionally and mentally.\" Richardson began his career as a spin bowler but gained a reputation as a patient accumulator of runs, scoring four Test centuries.\\n\\nHis highest score of 145 came against India in Chandigarh in October 2003. New Zealand\\'s recent tour of Bangladesh saw Richardson complete the set of visits to all 10 Test-playing nations. However, his batting approach and fielding ability did not suit the one-day game and he played in just four internationals. Nicknamed \\'Rigor Mortis\\' because of his slowness in the field, Richardson established a tradition of racing the slowest member of the opposition teams in recent seasons. \"Have you seen the color of my hair and the big bald spot on the top of my head?\" he quipped. \"I\\'m 33 but I\\'ve got the agility of about a 55-year-old.\" The Auckland native, who has written a regular column for BBC Sport for the last three years, intends to pursue a career in the media. New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming says Michael Papps is favourite to take Richardson\\'s place in the forthcoming series against Sri Lanka and Australia.\\nLara injury worry for West Indies\\n\\nVB Series, Perth, Match nine: West Indies v Pakistan\\n\\nPlay starts Friday 0315 GMT\\n\\nLara is expected to play in Perth despite a wrist injury, with the winners taking on hosts Australia. Pedro Collins (thigh strain) and Ramnesh Sarwan (bruised elbow) are also injury concerns for the Windies. Pakistan are without leading bastman Younis Khan, who has flown home following the death of his father. Their skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq believes the three-wicket victory over Australia in Perth on Sunday will give his side the upper hand. He said: \"Definitely we have the advantage because we have played one Test match and played in Perth for 15 or 16 days before that. \"This track is totally different and West Indies are playing for the first time here. \"This win has definitely helped us for the coming games. Hopefully we will play the final and we will win,\" he added. Inzamam is wary of the in-form Lara after he belted 156 off 138 balls in a victory over Pakistan in Adelaide last Friday.\\n\\nBut he said his team had bowled better against Australia and warned Lara would need to be on top of his game with medium-pace bowler Naved-ul-Hasan and all-rounder Abdul Razzaq showing better form. \"I think he realises the bowling was not good in the last game. I think especially Naved and Razzaq have worked hard in the nets and they are good here.\" Lara conceded Pakistan may have the advantage but pointed out there were plenty of players within the West Indies squad, including himself, who had played at the Waca ground before. \"We\\'ve got some batsmen that have played here and we know exactly what the track is doing,\" said Lara.\\n\\n\"It is more a mental game than the physical side and who has had more experience at the Waca. \"What I am worried about with Pakistan is that they are going to be playing three games in five days,\" he said. \"Hopefully that can play on their mind and we will have a tired bunch.\"\\n\\nInzamam-ul-Haq (captain), Shoaib Malik, Yousuf Youhana, Salman Butt, Kamran Akmal (wkt), Abdul Razzaq, Shahid Afridi, Naved-ul-Hasan, Yasir Hameed, Rao Iftikhar, Mohammad Khalil.\\n\\nC H Gayle, W W Hinds, R R Sarwan, B C Lara (Capt) S Chanderpaul, R L Powell, D J J Bravo, C O Browne (Wkt) I D R Bradshaw, R D King, P T Collins.\\nWorld XI triumph in tsunami match\\n\\nTsunami Appeal match, Melbourne: ICC World XI 344-8 beat Asian 232 XI by 112 runs\\n\\nRicky Ponting hit 115 in a massive total of 344-8 after electing to bat first in front of a crowd of 70,101. Rahul Dravid top-scored with 75 not out in the Asian XI reply, after Virender Sehwag\\'s brisk 45. Daniel Vettori took 3-58 while England\\'s Darren Gough took a wicket and a catch. Shane Warne had 2-27. The game, broadcast in 122 countries to an estimated global television audience of one billion, has already raised nearly £6 million for the relief effort.\\n\\nAustralian Prime Minister John Howard tossed a coin to start the match. And afterwards the International Cricket Council chief executive, Malcolm Speed, paid tribute to the players for taking part. He said: \"This signifies the game\\'s compassion and commitment to provide as a much help as possible to enable the survivors of the Tsunami to rebuild their lives so far as this is possible.\" Ponting entertained the fans early on by hitting some big shots off Anil Kumble and Abdul Razzaq and the World XI\\'s run rate was soon ticking along at a healthy rate. Chris Cairns (69) and Brian Lara (52) enjoyed themselves as a middle order packed with stars delivered the goods.\\n\\nAnd there was plenty of time for the unorthodox - Australia tailender Glenn McGrath batted at number six, where he fell for a golden duck. Muttiah Muralitharan captured his wicket in overall figures of 3-59. It was a welcome comeback performance from the Sri Lankan who had been out injured for five months and who was almost caught up in the 26 December tragedy. Sehwag gave the Asian XI a good start as they reached 59-0 in the 10th over. But wickets regularly tumbled once he fell to a catch in the deep trying to hit Warne\\'s second ball for six.\\n\\nVettori got stuck into the middle order where Dravid played a lone hand with only Kumar Sangakkara - Gough\\'s sole victim - providing any meaningful support. The World XI were further boosted by the presence of Steve Waugh as a substitute fielder towards the end of the match. It was all wrapped up in the 40th over with the run out of Murali for a duck. Man of the match Ponting said: \"The whole day has been very, very special. \"It\\'s great that the cricket community around the world can play a huge part to raise some money to put a smile on some faces around the world.\" Asian XI captain Sourav Ganguly said: \"I hope we have contributed in whatever way we can to help the people who have suffered this disaster.\"\\n\\nSourav Ganguly (Ind/capt), Sanath Jayasuriya (SL), Virender Sehwag (Ind), Rahul Dravid (Ind), Yousuf Youhana (Pak), Kumar Sangakkara (SL), Abdul Razzaq (Pak), Chaminda Vaas (SL), Zaheer Khan (Ind), Anil Kumble (Ind), Muttiah Muralitharan (SL).

Trescothick said: \"We\\'re allowed the odd blip here and there. \"You don\\'t win eight in a row without being something special as a team.\" England\\'s main concern continues to be the fitness of Andrew Flintoff, who is recovering from a torn side muscle and may not be able to bowl in the Test. Trescothick said England had appreciated having two days off in Cape Town \"to chill out and relax\" in what is otherwise the most intense tour the players have ever experienced. But he voiced concern about Flintoff. \"Side strains can be quite difficult because it\\'s such a big area [for fast bowlers] to generate pace when they\\'re bowling,\" he said.\\n\\n\"He\\'s had six days off but he\\'s not sure how it\\'s going to react. We\\'ll see how he goes in the nets and hopefully he\\'ll come through unscathed. \"Any time you lose one of your bowlers it\\'s difficult but when it\\'s an all-rounder it creates a bit of a gap in the team so hopefully we are not going to get to that situation.\" The form of pace spearhead Steve Harmison is another concern. Trescothick said: \"Steve\\'s been fine throughout. [The ball\\'s] just not been coming out so well. \"Everyone goes through dips in form - it just depends how quickly pepole come back from those. But he\\'ll come back from that, we\\'re just waiting for it to happen. \"The guys are generally in good spirits, they needed the time off.\"\\n\\nGraeme Smith (capt), Nicky Boje, Mark Boucher, Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers, Boeta Dippenaar, Herschelle Gibbs, Andrew Hall, Jacques Kallis, Charl Langeveldt, Makhaya Ntini, Shaun Pollock, Jacques Rudolph, Dale Steyn.\\n\\nEngland: Marcus Trescothick, Andrew Strauss, Robert Key, Michael Vaughan (capt), Graham Thorpe, Andrew Flintoff, Geraint Jones (wkt), Ashley Giles, Simon Jones, Matthew Hoggard, Steve Harmison, Paul Collingwood, Gareth Batty, James Anderson, Chris Read, Ian Bell.\\nPakistan question warm-up venue\\n\\nPakistan have voiced concern about the choice of Dharamshala to stage their only warm-up game in India.\\n\\nTuesday\\'s practice session had to be cancelled because of rain and the forecast is gloomy until the weekend. They are also worried about a travel schedule which could disrupt practice in Mohali, venue for the first Test. \"If we have to go back the same way we came, in two flights, we may not be able to practice on Sunday,\" said team manager Salim Altaf. \"We will get only one day\\'s nets in Mohali.\" Pakistan are due to begin a three-day game against an Indian Board President\\'s XI at altitude at Dharamshala on Thursday. But the players could only watch the skies from their hotel after an hour-long drive from Kangra airport where they had arrived in two planes because of its short runway. \"We are helpless before nature,\" said Anurag Thakur, president of the local Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association. \"Everybody is keeping their fingers crossed,\" he added.\\n\\n\"We are here to play and do not want to go into the Test series short of match practice. \"I wish the rain would go away,\" said Altaf. Meanwhile, chief selector Wasim Bari is hopeful that Shoaib Akhtar\\'s absence can inspire Mohammad Sami to a new level on the tour. Akhtar will miss the Test series because of hamstring trouble, but is hoping to return for the one-dayers. \"He\\'ll be missed and every player needs 25% extra to overcome his loss, but one hopes with the responsibilty, the best in Sami will come out,\" Bari said.\\n\\n\"They can spring a surprise in India, I think we have a talented side.\" Bari feels the team is capable of responding favourably to the disappointment of their tour to Australia, which saw them heavily beaten in all three-day Tests, and also lose the final of the triangular one-day series. \"Obviously they made some mistakes on their last tour of Australia, but they must capitalise on the lessons they learnt,\" Bari observed. \"Good results will pave the way for the young team to get on the right path and attain more maturity.\" The tour is Pakistan\\'s first to India since 1999 and they are looking to atone for last year\\'s home defeat by their arch-rivals. The Dalai Lama, who has lived in exile in Dharamshala since fleeing China in 1959, will not inaugurate Thursday\\'s match as originally planned. There were reports that the Pakistan Cricket Board were concerned about his presence because of their country\\'s good relations with China. \"The decision has been taken by the Dalai Lama as he didn\\'t want to cause inconvenience to anyone,\" said his spokesman, Tenzin Takla.\\nKumble breaks Kapil\\'s record\\n\\nFirst Test, Dhaka, day one (stumps): Bangladesh 184 all out v India\\n\\nKumble overtook the mark set by Kapil Dev when he had Mohammad Rafique lbw. And he followed up with a wicket next ball before Bangladesh were bowled out for 184 in 58 overs in Dhaka. After the first session was lost to rain, Irfan Pathan took five wickets to reduce the hosts to 106-7 before Mohammad Ashraful dug in. Ashraful ended unbeaten on 60, having hit six fours and faced 135 balls. Kumble had a chance of a hat-trick after removing Tapash Baisya via a catch at first slip but Mashrafe Mortaza safely defended the fifth ball of his 12th over. But a run out ended the innings not long afterwards.\\n\\nIndia did not get chance to begin their reply as openers Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir were immediately offered the light on stepping to the wicket. India won the toss and Pathan soon got stuck into the top order, dismissing Javed Omar lbw in his second over with one that nipped back. Nafis Iqbal and Rajin Saleh were also ajudged lbw by umpire Jeremy Lloyds off consecutive balls in Pathan\\'s fifth over. Captain Habibul Bashar then pulled Zaheer Khan straight to square leg and when the same bowler had Khaled Mashud caught behind, Bangladesh were 50-5 after just 16 overs. Ashraful, largely in partnership with Rafique (47), did his best to build a recovery but India will expect to amass a huge lead on Saturday. Kumble is now fifth in the all-time list. Aged 34, he may still be able to reach the 500-mark, passed by only three men. Fellow leg-spinner Shane Warne tops the list with 552 wickets.\\n\\nHabibul Bashar (capt), Nafis Iqbal, Javed Omar, Mohammad Ashraful, Rajin Saleh, Khaled Mashud (wkt), Mushfiqur Rahman, Mohammad Rafique, Tapash Baisya, Mashrafe bin Mortaza, Manjurul Islam Rana.\\n\\nS Ganguly (capt), V Sehwag, G Gambhir, S Tendulkar, R Dravid, M Kaif, D Karthik (wkt), I Pathan, A Kumble, Harbhajan Singh, Z Khan.\\nWindies Australia tour to proceed\\n\\nWest Indies are set to tour Australia after a row over sponsorship deals for individual players neared resolution.\\n\\nThe dispute began because of conflicts between West Indies Cricket Board sponsor Digicel and Cable & Wireless, who endorse a number of the players. Both sides have accepted a ruling on whether players can have their own deals, but that has not been disclosed. \"We are convinced we will have a resolution that allows the tour to proceed,\" arbiter Keith Mitchell said. Mitchell, the Prime Minister of Grenada, appointed judge Adrian Saunders to make a binding ruling on the issue, but he refused to reveal what the ruling was. The impasse has delayed the announcement of West Indies\\' 14-man squad to play in the limited-overs tournament with Australia and Pakistan. It will be the first competition they have taken part in since winning the ICC Champions Trophy in England three months ago. They are due to play their first warm-up match against Victoria on 5 January.\\nSri Lanka reschedule NZ Test tour\\n\\nSri Lanka have rescheduled their Test series in New Zealand for April after cutting short the original tour because of the Asian tsunami disaster.\\n\\nThe team will play a warm-up game before embarking on two Tests against the Kiwis, starting on 4 and 11 April. Members of the Sri Lankan squad will be in New Zealand later this month to play for a World XI in three one-day games. They will take place on 22, 24 and 26 January and money raised will go to help the tsunami relief appeal. Australian Shane Warne will captain the World side, with South African Jonty Rhodes acting as player-coach. And the matches raise the prospect of Warne bowling in tandem with Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan for the first time. Former England batsmen Nick Knight and Graeme Hick will be also part of the squad. \"We hope to break even from the series or to run at a manageable loss,\" said New Zealand Cricket chief Martin Snedden. \"It will be expensive but the benefits for the home cricket season and the Black Caps, as well as those who benefit from our fund-raising activities, will make the series more than worthwhile.\"\\n\\nThe series will also be backed by the Federation of International Cricketers\\' Associations, under whose name the World XI will play. \"We believe we have a responsibility to do whatever we can to support other members of the cricketing community. \"In forming the inaugural FICA World XI, we are able to support ICC member countries and the larger community at what is a very difficult time. \"The series will give us an opportunity to raise valuable funds through related charitable activities and ensure New Zealand has international cricket at the height of its summer,\" said FICA chief executive Tim May. The venues for Sri Lanka\\'s Tests in New Zealand have yet to be decided. And there is concern that weather could be a factor in the series. But Snedden said:\"The climatic conditions in early April are normally similar to those in March and we are confident Test cricket can be played at this time of year. \"A decision about the venues for the re-scheduled Tests should be made within the next two weeks. \"We are also working with the Sri Lankan Cricket Board to reschedule the unplayed one-day international matches and hope to play a four-match ODI series during next season\\'s Christmas/New Year period.\"\\n\\nS Warne (capt), M Bevan, A Bichel, M Elliott, A Flower, I Harvey, G Hick, S Jayasuriya, L Klusener, N Knight, M Muralitharan, J Rhodes, K Sangakkara, H Streak, C Vaas.\\nAussie McGrath to take match off\\n\\nThird one-day international, Auckland: New Zealand v Australia\\n\\nMatch begins 0100 GMT\\n\\nOpener Matthew Hayden will also sit out the match because of a shoulder injury suffered in the second game on Tuesday. McGrath\\'s place goes to Michael Kasprowicz while Simon Katich replaces Hayden, and will open the batting in preference to Michael Clarke. New Zealand trail 2-0 and need to win in Auckland to keep the five-match series alive. The Black Caps dropped batsman Mathew Sinclair after the opening two defeats, calling in opener Michael Papps and all-rounder Andre Adams. But Adams has been ruled out due to illness, adding to the home side\\'s woes after Scott Styris injured his knee. Batsman James Marshall will make his international debut after acting as 12th man in the last game.\\n\\nMarshall is the identical twin of Hamish Marshall, New Zealand\\'s best batsman in the first match. News that several batsmen had spent time with the team psychologist on Wednesday added to the air of desperation in the New Zealand camp. But captain Stephen Fleming played that down, and emphasised pride is at stake with three games left in the series. \"We\\'re pretty determined; we know the importance of the match to keep the series alive,\" he said. \"But more importantly we want to play up to the standard we have over the last 12-24 months.\"\\n\\nAustralia have now won 10 of their last 11 one-day matches against New Zealand. And captain Ricky Ponting was in no mood to loosen his side\\'s grip on the series against their local rivals. \"Sure we\\'re in a great position and we\\'ve played some pretty good cricket but we still think we can keep improving,\" he said. \"All we can do is keep trying to win and keep trying to improve, and if that means we get a psychological hold over New Zealand then well and good.\"\\n\\nS Fleming (Capt), N Astle, H Marshall, C McMillan, C Cairns, B McCullum (Wkt), D Vettori, J Wilson, K Mills, D Tuffey, M Papps, J Marshall.\\n\\nR Ponting (captain), A Gilchrist, S Katich, D Martyn, M Clarke, M Hussey, A Symonds, B Hogg, B Lee, J Gillespie, M Kasprowicz.\\nEngland require extra \\'intensity\\'\\n\\nBatsman Graham Thorpe has acknowledged that England need to raise their game ahead of the first Test against South Africa, which starts on Friday.\\n\\nThe team have arrived in Port Elizabeth after being given a wake-up call in a seven-wicket loss to South Africa A. \"We lacked intensity and we need to rise to the level South Africa will be at,\" Thorpe commented. \"We\\'re a fraction short of where we need to be and some of us will need to scrap really hard in the first Test.\" Former England seam bowler Angus Fraser has criticised an itinerary which gave the team just a single first-class match ahead of the Test series, even though most of the team had not played since September. \"In an ideal world, the batsmen would have liked to have spent more time at the crease, but it\\'s important that we don\\'t get down on ourselves. \"We\\'re going to have dig deep into the memory banks and remember the times we\\'ve done well against them,\" said Thorpe, who faced just 13 balls in Potchefstroom in making 0 and 11.\\n\\n\"The good thing about not spending too long at the crease is that I don\\'t know whether I\\'m in bad form or not.\" The Surrey left-hander, England\\'s most experienced player with 93 Tests, says the team must keep their nerve. \"The key is not to panic too much and find the right balance between enjoyment and wanting to win. \"You need to put your state of mind into a position where you\\'re going to enjoy the match, but you\\'re going to be competitive.\" \"You have to be able to enjoy the challenge because it\\'s not always a bed of roses out there. \"You\\'re not always creaming it around so part of it is enjoying the challenge of maybe feeling a little bit more under pressure and wanting to perform.\"\\n\\nSouth Africa, meanwhile, have seen their preparations disrupted by a clutch of illnesses and injury problems.\\n\\nSkipper Graeme Smith, batsman Boeta Dippenaar and all-rounders Andrew Hall and Zander de Bruyn have been suffering from stomach problems since the recent tour to India and wicket-keeper Thami Tsolekile has been trying to shake off a throat infection. More worrying, however, is the fitness of spin bowler Nicky Boje who recently underwent surgery to remove a tumour from his neck. They are likely to give him as long as possible to recover before finalising their Test XI. \"We\\'re still working with him, it\\'s a day-by-day process,\" said team physio Shane Jabaar.\\nStrauss ton boosts England\\n\\nFirst Test, Port Elizabeth (day two, close): South Africa 337; England 227-1\\n\\nStrauss was 120 not out after two days in Port Elizabeth as England closed inexorably on the hosts\\' 337 all out. He put on 152 for the first wicket with Marcus Trescothick and added more runs with Mark Butcher with no England batsman prepared to miss out. Earlier, Boeta Dippenaar converted his overnight 79 into a century of his own. The day began with South Africa 273-7 and hoping to reach at least 350 with Dippenaar and Thami Tsolekile batting together. Tsolekile initially looked uncomfortable against some short-pitched Andrew Flintoff bowling. But Steve Harmison\\'s radar was awry and though runs came slowly, there was little penetration from England\\'s seamers.\\n\\nDippenaar eventually lifted the shackles by driving Harmison through the covers for four. An even better drive in the same area took him to 98 before he put Harmison high over gully for four more, reaching only his third Test century. Finally, well into the second hour, Michael Vaughan turned to his freshest bowler, Simon Jones. The Welshman struck immediately as Dippenaar edged into the safe hands of Marcus Trescothick at first slip. Tsolekile, having hit one excellent boundary off Ashley Giles, rashly attempted another soon after the loss of Dippenaar.\\n\\nIt was a big mistake, though. Slogging across the line and against the spin, he skewed the ball up into the covers for Andrew Flintoff to run round from slip to take the catch. Giles removed the last man, Dale Steyn, and from 324-7 South Africa had tumbled to 337 all out. Strauss and Trescothick had a potentially awkward four overs before lunch to negotiate. But having managed that, they rarely looked troubled in the second session of the day.\\n\\nStrauss, with a series of cuts and pulls, was the more attacking partner, while Trescothick was seeking to play himself into some form. South Africa were severely limited by having five right-arm seamers at their disposal and no spinner and when the score rattled along to 152-0 shortly after tea they looked in deep trouble. But debutant Steyn, who had bowled a rash of no-balls in a nervous first spell, suddenly found some extra pace and a bit of reverse swing to bowl Trescothick for 47, the ball crashing into middle stump. Shaun Pollock also got the ball to reverse in the air, as the runs dried up with Mark Butcher trying to find his feet and Strauss worrying about a possible century. But once Strauss drove Ntini immaculately down the ground for four to reach three figures, Butcher cashed in with two crisp cover-drives of his own for boundaries off Andrew Hall. It was a weary South African fielding side who marched off the park at stumps.\\n\\nG Smith (captain), AB de Villiers, J Rudolph, J Kallis, B Dippenaar, Z de Bruyn, A Hall, S Pollock, T Tsolekile (wk), M Ntini, D Steyn.\\n\\nM Vaughan (captain), M Trescothick, A Strauss, M Butcher, G Thorpe, A Flintoff, G Jones (wk), A Giles, S Jones, M Hoggard, S Harmison.\\nEngland stutter to Zimbabwe win\\n\\nFirst one-day international, Harare: England 196-5 (47.4 overs) beat Zimbabwe 195 all out (49.3 overs) by five wickets\\n\\nAfter choosing to bowl, they dismissed the home side for 195, Darren Gough with 3-34, Elton Chigumbura making 52. The 18-year-old shared a stand of 82 in 13.3 overs with Dion Ebrahim (45). Michael Vaughan made an attractive 56 and debutant Ian Bell 77 but late wickets created tension before victory was sealed with 14 balls left.\\n\\nVaughan chose to open his attack with Gough and James Anderson, but both found it difficult to attain a good line in the early stages. Anderson conceded three wides in the eighth over and both openers had recorded boundaries when, in the ninth over, a slower ball from Gough accounted for Stuart Matsikenyeri with the score on 36. Two overs later Alex Wharf picked up a fortuitous wicket with his fifth delivery when Brendan Taylor dragged a wide one onto the timbers.\\n\\nA far more dangerous delivery accounted for Vusi Sibanda, who was unable to keep out a rising ball. The hosts had a brief period of consolidation only to ruin it with a run-out as Mark Vermeulen was left short of his ground by a direct throw from Andrew Strauss. When Tatenda Taibu became the third batsmen to drag on, something special was required, and briefly it came from Chigumbura. The lissome right-hander launched a series of clean, straight-bladed shots, hammering six fours and a magnificent straight six off Wharf in his 56-minute innings. Ebrahim was beaten in the flight by Ashley Giles, then in the next over Chigumbura went for one lofted drive too many and was caught deep in the covers.\\n\\nA crowd of around 3,000 had been delighted with his efforts, but when he departed at 172-7 there was little else from the tail, Gough wrapping up the innings with a yorker in the final over. England\\'s reply began smoothly until Vikram Solanki mis-timed a drive that looped to mid-off for seven. Vaughan gradually unveiled some trademark strokes of classic nature in a 75-ball innings featuring five fours and a six. He departed in the 30th over with 64 still needed, caught at deep midwicket by Chigumbura, who in the same position had spilled a chance offered by Bell four overs earlier. Andrew Strauss was soon back in the pavilion, offering a simple return catch to Matsikenyeri to leave England 146-3.\\n\\nHaving seemed set to guide his team home, Bell\\'s composed innings ended 26 runs short of the victory target when he edged his 115th delivery to Taibu. Paul Collingwood needlessly pressed for a second run and fell to sharp throw from Utseya at leg gully, then next ball Geraint Jones almost joined him after hesitation with Kevin Pietersen. The debutant was content to edge England home in conservative fashion, but won it with his only boundary straight down the ground, as the tourists finally secured their ninth successive win over Zimbabwe.\\n\\nIndia wrap up victory in Dhaka\\n\\nFirst Test, Dhaka: Bangladesh 184 & 202 v India 526\\n\\nIndia win by an innings and 140 runs\\n\\nLeft-arm paceman Irfan Pathan removed Tapash Baisya for 29 to finish with figures of 6-51, and 11-96 overall. Zaheer Khan claimed the final wicket when he had the diligent Manjural Islam Rana caught behind for 69. The home side, 170-8 overnight, subsided for 202 to slump to defeat by an innings and 140 runs. Bangladesh were left with a daunting task after Sachin Tendulkar\\'s record unbeaten 248 helped India to a total of 526, a lead of 342.\\n\\nOnly Nafis Iqbal (54) and Islam Rana offered any real resistance as the hosts were routed in double-quick time. In their 33 Tests since 2000, Bangladesh have now accumulated 30 defeats, with only three draws to their credit. The second and final Test of the series starts in Chittagong on Friday.\\n\\nHabibul Bashar (capt), Nafis Iqbal, Javed Omar, Mohammad Ashraful, Rajin Saleh, Khaled Mashud (wkt), Mushfiqur Rahman, Mohammad Rafique, Tapash Baisya, Mashrafe Mortaza, Manjurul Islam Rana.\\n\\nS Ganguly (capt), V Sehwag, G Gambhir, S Tendulkar, R Dravid, M Kaif, D Karthik (wkt), I Pathan, A Kumble, Harbhajan Singh, Z Khan.\\nBSkyB lands England deal\\n\\nLive coverage of England\\'s home Test matches will no longer be available on terrestrial TV from 2006 onwards.\\n\\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board has awarded an exclusive four-year contract to BSkyB, which will run until 2009. Highlights of each day\\'s play in the Test matches will, however, be screened on Five, which replaces Channel 4 as cricket\\'s sole terrestrial broadcaster. The BBC has retained the exclusive rights for radio coverage of home Tests and one-day internationals. England and Wales Cricket Board chairman David Morgan said the various deals would be worth £220m, a 10% real terms increase on the previous agreements for 2002-2005. \"We understand that the decision to place all live cricket coverage on satellite and cable television is an emotive issue for some people,\" he continued. \"We have made an agreement that will offer the highlights package to a peaktime audience. \"Five will broadcast highlights from 7.15-8.00pm, a time which is the most popular slot for TV viewing for children and a time when an average of 21m people watch television.\" BSkyB\\'s package also covers one-day, Twenty20 and women\\'s internationals as well as county cricket.\\n\\nChannel 4 has screened England\\'s home Test matches since 1999, when they ended the BBC\\'s 61-year tenure. And the decision to prevent cricket from being seen live by a terrestrial TV audience is a calculated gamble by the ECB.\\n\\nFormer England captain Alec Stewart, speaking on Tuesday, said: \"Young girls and boys should be able to see cricket without having to pay for it. \"The ECB have to look at the whole picture. They may be getting a big cheque but long-term, English cricket will suffer.\" And Morgan\\'s predecessor, Lord MacLaurin, had also called for \"balance\" between satellite and terrestrial TV. \"I think there is a big danger....of depriving an awful lot of people of watching Test cricket,\" he commented.\\n\\nBut the ECB believes a strong financial base is essential to the game\\'s well-being.\\n\\n\"The bids we accepted allow us to invest even more in the development of the England team and grass roots cricket. \"Other proposals included live coverage of some international cricket on terrestrial TV but, if accepted, they would have resulted in a significant financial shortfall for the game and it was decided that this was not in the best interest of the sport,\" explained Morgan. \"This is a very good deal for cricket as it guarantees wide accessibility to watch or listen to the action and secures the future development of the game from playground to Test arena.\" Commenting on the BBC\\'s renewed agreement with the ECB, Director of Sport, Peter Salmon, said: \"With the England team on top form, we are pleased to provide listeners with the most comprehensive radio coverage on Test Match Special.\" The BBC will also have non-exclusive rights to cover the C&G Trophy and Twenty20 Cup - the later shared with the Wireless Group, which owns Talksport Radio.\\n\\n\\n - Test series covered by the new contract: \\n - 2006 v Sri Lanka and Pakistan \\n - 2007 v West Indies and India \\n - 2008 v Zimbabwe and South Africa \\n - 2009 v New Zealand and Australia\\nScotland take small step into the big time\\n\\nThere was no winner\\'s cheque on offer and no increase in status, just a trip to Sharjah, a shiny trophy and the prestige of being considered the 11th-best team in world cricket.\\n\\nBut Scotland were still celebrating heartily after winning the ICC Intercontinental Cup, beating Kenya and Canada in the final stages in the United Arab Emirates. Men in suits can talk for as long as they like about infrastructure and development pathways, but sport is about winning, and Scotland came through where it mattered. Pace bowler John Blain, who was man of the match in the final after taking seven wickets, fully realised the importance of an innings victory over Canada. \"We\\'ve been moving on for a number of years now, narrowly missing out on the World Cup but this is the next-best thing,\" he told BBC Sport. \"We\\'ve always been confident of what ability we have but it\\'s about getting results.\" The victory means more than some silverware for the cabinet, however, for a team that appeared in the 1999 World Cup but has not made highlight reels since. The majority of the side are still amateurs and, as Blain pointed out: \"It\\'s very difficult for guys to go from the World Cup back to their jobs and keep the standard up.\"\\n\\nThe International Cricket Council is keen to improve the strength and depth behind the 10 Test-playing nations, and this is just a part of its development programme. Five associate member countries will appear in the 2007 World Cup and the authorities are keen they should provide more than a second-round bye for the bigger sides. Senior coach Bob Woolmer suggested that the three-day format would help hone skills for the limited-overs game. Blain gives the idea the thumbs-up but also believes Scotland\\'s exposure to English county cricket\\'s National League (NCL) has helped. \"The guys have come here and played the cricket that they\\'ve been playing the last couple of years in the NCL but in a longer version of the game,\" he said. \"They\\'ve learned how to be ruthless and go for the victory.\" With some controversy, this tournament was given first-class status, although only a handful of players - including Blain and Durham\\'s Gavin Hamilton - normally play at that level.\\n\\nWith Kenya lacking 13 players because of a pay dispute and Canada losing World Cup star John Davison to Australian domestic duty, the standard was below county level. However, Blain argued: \"I\\'ve had seven-wicket hauls in county cricket but this must rate among them - it\\'s international cricket and it\\'s the top of the tree.\" This win will help strengthen Scotland\\'s claim for full-time one-day international status, saving them from the qualification process. They will have to prove themselves again next April when the ICC Trophy in Ireland will act as a World Cup qualifier but Blain believes consistency is building. \"Results are now starting to show. We have a squad of boys who can compete,\" he continued. \"We\\'ve got more exposure now and the standard has moved on fantastically, which will stand us in good stead when we go on to the qualifiers.\" The Intercontinental Cup is not an end in itself but a significant milestone along the way.\\nPakistan slump in Twenty20 debut\\n\\nTwenty20 tour match, Adelaide: Australia A 185-5 (20 overs) beat Pakistan 129-7 (20 overs) by 56 runs\\n\\nHussey, who made 50 from 43 deliveries, was joined by White joined him in a fifth-wicket stand of 79 in Adelaide. And White upped the pace at the end, ending 58 not out from 38 balls as the hosts posted 185-5 before 21,254 fans. Pakistan crashed to 17-4 in the fifth over but reached 129-7, Taufeeq Umar top-scoring with 31 from 20 balls. Australia\\'s start, after opting to bat first, was similarly inauspicious. Shoaib Akhtar, who had pain-killing injections earlier thisweek for back and hamstring injuries, took two for 37 from hisfour overs. Captain Brad Haddin, who scored 129 in Wednesday\\'s 50-over match between the two sides, fell for two. And James Hopes was be bowled in the pace man\\'s second over, the scoreline 27-2.\\n\\nBrad Hodge and Mike Hussey, both veterans of Twenty20 cricket in England, were unable to capitalise on blazing starts before the younger Hussey brother calmed proceedings. Tasmanian Damien Wright struck with two wickets in the space of three balls in the second over of the Pakistan reply and the tourists were in disarray. Umar played fluently, hitting just four boundaries, but could not find a partner as five batsmen fell in single figures. He and Inzamam-ul-Haq added 50 for the fifth wicket but the Pakistan captain was run out for 21. Although Younis Khan (28) and Iftikhar Anjum (21) kept the pace brisk, they were well off the required pace in an unbeaten partnership of 58.\\n\\nBoth sides were penalised six runs for slow over-rates. Twenty20 cricket, which involves batsmen sitting on the boundary edge waiting to go in and bowlers given reduced time to get through their overs, was first launched in county cricket in 2002. It has since taken off domestically in South Africa and in women\\'s cricket, where the first international involved England and New Zealand last year. New Zealand and Sri Lanka had planned to play the first Twenty20 international but the tour was cut short because of the tsunami disaster. Australia\\'s senior team will get their first taste of the shortened format in June, when they tour England. Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said Twenty20 cricket between state sides could be a possibility for next year. \"It\\'s happening in other parts of the world and has been embraced at domestic cricket level,\" he said. \"The signals we\\'re getting in these last two days is that it\\'s something the fans are interested in seeing more of. \"And we need to look at the way in which we can introduce it on perhaps a more formal basis next season.\" Inzamam predicted Twenty20 could become the most popular form of the sport worldwide. \"I think after four or five years this will be the most popular game, (compared to) 50-over games and Test matches,\" he said. \"Now it\\'s very popular. After one or two years it will be the most popular game.\" But Haddin said: \"I think Test cricket will always be the most popular form of the game.\"\\n\\nJR Hopes, BJ Haddin, BJ Hodge, MEK Hussey, DJ Hussey, CL White, DJ Thornely, NW Bracken, DG Wright, SW Tait\\n\\nYasir Hameed, Taufeeq Umar, Shahid Afridi, Mohammad Hafeez, Abdul Razzaq, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Azhar Mahmood, Younis Khan, Iftikhar Anjum, Mohammad Khalil, Shoaib Akhtar.\\nNew Zealand to step up security\\n\\nNew Zealand cricket officials are to review security after Australia players were hit by missiles during Saturday\\'s opening one-day international.\\n\\nThe match was stopped several times after Australian fielders complained they had been hit by plastic bottles. New Zealand Cricket chief executive Martin Snedden labelled the missile throwing \"unacceptable\". \"It wasn\\'t the number of security guards, it was the fact they needed to be more proactive,\" he said. Australia captain Ricky Ponting complained immediately after his side\\'s 10-run win. \"Someone\\'s going to get hurt. You have to have more security guys around the players on the boundary,\" he said. However, Kiwi coach John Bracewell accused Australia of using the crowd as a delaying tactic.\\n\\nHe claimed the missile-throwing was no different to the treatment his players got in Australia. Former Australia skipper Steve Waugh threatened to take his players off the field after similar crowd disturbances in New Zealand five years ago. \"I think the tactical awareness as learned by Steve Waugh has been passed on,\" Bracewell said. Despite being hit by a missile at one point, Aussie bowler Glenn McGrath was the star of the show, returning figures of 4-16. \"Glenn was outstanding and we just did enough to win,\" Ponting said. \"It\\'s a very hard place to win over here and we found that out tonight.\" New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming praised Hamish Marshall, whose 76 almost rescued the match. \"We were out of it, came back really well - Hamish was outstanding - but we just lost our way towards the end.\"\\nZimbabwe bowlers endure hard toil\\n\\nTour match, Chittagong (stumps, day one of three): Bangladesh Cricket Board XI 316-7d; Zimbabwe 41-0\\n\\nBy stumps on day one of the three-day match, the Bangladesh Cricket Board XI had declared on 316-7, with Zimbabwe replying safely enough to be 41-0. For the tourists, leg-spinner Matsikenyeri, generally regarded as a batsman, had figures of 4-58. Tushar Imran compiled an unbeaten 102, with Nafees Ahmed contributing 97. Fringe Test player Rajin Saleh, who was captaining the BCB XI, helped put on 112 for the third wicket with Nafees. Five wickets then fell for the addition of just 34 runs as Matsikenyeri, the sixth bowler tried, had a major impact. But Tushar and Tareq Aziz (19 not out) then added 123 in an unbroken partnership for the eighth wicket. At that point the declaration came and Zimbabwe\\'s openers Matsikenyeri and Barney Rogers survived 10 overs before stumps were drawn.\\n\\nShahriar Nadees, Shamsur Rahman, Saqib Al Wasan, Rajin Saleh (capt), Tushar Imran, Al Sahariar, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mohammad Sharif, Tareq Aziz, Shahadat Hossain, Shafaq Al Zabir.\\n\\nBarney Rogers, Stuart Matsikenyeri, Brendan Taylor, Vusi Sibanda, Tatenda Taibu (capt/wk), Elton Chigumbura, Tinashe Panyangara, Douglas Hondo, Prosper Utseya, Tawanda Mupariwa, ANO.\\nPakistan have the edge - Mushtaq\\n\\nMushtaq Ahmed believes Pakistan are on the verge of their first Test series win in India for 18 years.\\n\\nImran Khan was the last Pakistan captain to return home victorious, and India are favourites for the three-Test series starting on 8 March. But former Test spinner Mushtaq told BBC Sport: \"Pakistan have the advantage because of the confidence they would have gained from playing Australia. \"They showed in the one-day series they had learned from their mistakes.\" After losing the Test series 3-0, Pakistan improved throughout the triangular VB Series, beating Australia in a group game and advancinhg to the finals at the expense of Champions Trophy winners West Indies. \"I know Pakistan didn\\'t win,\" Mushtaq added. \"But they had very good games. \"The amount of cricket they played against the best team in the world will serve them well in India. \"I think they will play with more freedom and I think they have a good chance.\"\\n\\nMushtaq, who took 185 wickets in a 52-Test career for Pakistan, is not concerned about the absence of fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, who pulled out of the tour with a hamstring injury. \"Shoaib Akhtar is a match-winner for sure, but the other bowlers did a great job against Australia,\" he said. \"I think Danish Kaneria will play a big role, as will Mohammad Sami. So, despite Shoaib not being there, I think the Pakistani team looks well balanced.\" It is a view not shared by former captain Mushtaq Mohammad, who told the Press Trust of India the squad is the \"weakest-ever\" Pakistan has produced. \"The team that visited England in 1978-79 under Wasim Bari was definitely weak, but it was unavoidable as there was ban on cricketers who had signed for Kerry Packer,\" he said. \"I am sorry to say that this Pakistan team looks like a club team to me. \"Barring a couple of them, there are no quality batsmen in the side. They have faulty techniques, are too flashy, have no footwork, no temperament and consequently they are inconsistent. \"I desperately want my country to do well in India and win the Test series because this series means a lot to the people of Pakistan. \"But sadly, cricket is not played with emotions. It is played with talent and skill. \"I hope my assessment about the team is incorrect and if they prove me wrong, I will be the happiest man on this planet.\"\\nEngland victory tainted by history\\n\\nAs England attempt to secure a series victory in South Africa, they will do so at the venue for a previous match which became the stuff of Test cricket folklore.\\n\\nSouth Africa\\'s meeting with England at Centurion Park in January 2000 was thought to have been an enthralling spectacle, with the tourists claiming a remarkable win after three whole days were lost to bad weather. It took a few short months to reveal the unfortunate truth; that a bookmaker had given home skipper Hansie Cronje money - and a leather jacket - to influence the outcome of the match. Cronje, who was killed two years later in a plane crash, was subsequently found guilty of match-fixing and banned from Test cricket for life. Opening the bowling for England was Andy Caddick, who told BBC Sport: \"They were 2-0 up in the series, we had a lot of English supporters there and South Africa just wanted to make a game of it. That\\'s what I thought. \"At the time you don\\'t think anything of it but then afterwards you start to put two and two together, with events that happened afterwards.\" England captain Nasser Hussain put the South Africans in after winning the toss, and was given an early reward, of a purely cricketing nature, when Gary Kirsten edged Darren Gough to second slip for a duck in the first over.\\n\\nCronje also fell to Gough for a duck as the home side closed the first day 155-6. The next three days were then wiped out competely due to a combination of rain and damp ground conditions before Cronje approached Hussain with a suggestion to manufacture a result. South Africa had already secured the series having won in Johannesburg and Cape Town, but Cronje (and his friends) wanted to create some interest in the final day at Centurion. The idea was for each side to forfeit an innings each, leaving the tourists with a run chase, so South Africa reached 248-8 on the final morning to set England 249 from 76 overs. Kirsten was one of several players opposed to the move, as he explained to BBC Sport. \"Hansie came up to us in the changing room on the last day and said: \\'I\\'m keen to forfeit the innings and set the total.\\'\\n\\n\"He asked the team and there was a mixed reception. \"Some of the guys felt we didn\\'t want to give England a chance of winning - you don\\'t mess around with Test matches - and some said nothing! \"Hansie just decided, and maybe we know why in hindsight, to go for it but there was quite a bit of resistance and some of the guys didn\\'t think it was a good idea at all.\" England\\'s 12th man that day was Phil Tufnell, who recalled: \"Everyone thought it was a very good gesture in the spirit of the game. \"The game had meandered along and all of a sudden it was like an old fashioned three-day county game and we were having a chase.\" Whatever the reasons - later it emerged that Cronje\\'s part had been simply to ensure against a draw - it led to a fascinating cricket match.\\n\\nEngland needed six from the final seven balls and Yorkshire tailenders Chris Silverwood and Darren Gough both hit boundaries to give them a two-wicket victory. \"It ended as a great day for cricket,\" Kirsten conceded. \"One could argue it was good for people who had been frustrated having not watched any cricket and suddenly got a great last day. \"But from a player\\'s point of view you\\'ve worked so hard for three months trying to win a Test series that you don\\'t give Test matches away, or create the opportunity to make it easy to win one.\" Tufnell has favourable memories of Cronje, who played county cricket for Leicestershire in the 1990s. \"He always came across as a nice bloke,\" the spinner said. \"He always came and said \\'Hi\\' and seemed a very intelligent captain, a good competitor and a good ambassador for South African cricket.\" Kirsten too recalls some positive images of Cronje. \"We all know that what he did cannot be condoned in any circumstances,\" he said. \"But my view is he did a huge amount for my career. \"I thought he was an outstanding captain and I\\'ve made mistakes in my life so I\\'m not in a position to be judgemental.\"\\nWeather worry for Pakistan\\n\\nPakistan have voiced concern about the choice of Dharamshala to stage their only warm-up game in India.\\n\\nTuesday\\'s practice session had to be cancelled because of rain and the forecast is gloomy until the weekend. They are also worried about a travel schedule which could disrupt practice in Mohali, venue for the first Test. \"If we have to go back the same way we came, in two flights, we may not be able to practice on Sunday,\" said team manager Salim Altaf. \"We will get only one day\\'s nets in Mohali.\" Pakistan are due to begin a three-day game against an Indian Board President\\'s XI at altitude at Dharamshala on Thursday. But the players could only watch the skies from their hotel after an hour-long drive from Kangra airport where they had arrived in two planes because of its short runway. \"We are helpless before nature,\" said Anurag Thakur, president of the local Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association. \"Everybody is keeping their fingers crossed,\" he added.\\n\\n\"We are here to play and do not want to go into the Test series short of match practice. \"I wish the rain would go away,\" said Altaf. Meanwhile, chief selector Wasim Bari is hopeful that Shoaib Akhtar\\'s absence can inspire Mohammad Sami to a new level on the tour. Akhtar will miss the Test series because of hamstring trouble, but is hoping to return for the one-dayers. \"He\\'ll be missed and every player needs 25% extra to overcome his loss, but one hopes with the responsibilty, the best in Sami will come out,\" Bari said.\\n\\n\"They can spring a surprise in India, I think we have a talented side.\" Bari feels the team is capable of responding favourably to the disappointment of their tour to Australia, which saw them heavily beaten in all three-day Tests, and also lose the final of the triangular one-day series. \"Obviously they made some mistakes on their last tour of Australia, but they must capitalise on the lessons they learnt,\" Bari observed. \"Good results will pave the way for the young team to get on the right path and attain more maturity.\" The tour is Pakistan\\'s first to India since 1999 and they are looking to atone for last year\\'s home defeat by their arch-rivals. The Dalai Lama, who has lived in exile in Dharamshala since fleeing China in 1959, will not inaugurate Thursday\\'s match as originally planned. There were reports that the Pakistan Cricket Board were concerned about his presence because of their country\\'s good relations with China. \"The decision has been taken by the Dalai Lama as he didn\\'t want to cause inconvenience to anyone,\" said his spokesman, Tenzin Takla.\\nEngland fail to finish job again\\n\\nEngland have done their best throughout this series to suggest that they are vulnerable and, on a rain-hit third day at Centurion, their batsmen did it again.\\n\\nWhen Michael Vaughan horribly mis-pulled Shaun Pollock to square leg for a four-ball duck, England had lost three tame wickets for two runs in three overs. They seemed to be doing their best to keep the game open when they should have been doing their utmost to close it down. The first to go was Marcus Trescothick who was run out thanks to a misjudgement by Andrew Strauss. Trescothick - at the non-striker\\'s end - responded to Strauss\\'s call when he drove Makhaya Ntini to straight mid off. But Strauss suddenly changed his mind and as Trescothick tried desperately to regain his ground, Nicky Boje swooped one-handed and threw the stumps down direct. Robert Key fell three overs later when he was caught behind down the leg side for a single. Key glared at Umpire Bucknor when he raised his finger, and dragged himself off the ground, but replays suggested that he had, indeed, touched the ball.\\n\\nFour balls later, Vaughan was caught and England were reeling on 29-3. Andrew Strauss then appeared completely to lose touch and, frankly, Graham Thorpe has only very occasionally been in form throughout the series. The left-handers scratched about, barely laying bat on ball, but somehow they survived, despite some very close lbw appeals. They managed to add 85 between the interruptions until Strauss uncharacteristically chased a ball well wide of his off stump from Andre Nel and edged to Boucher for 44. Moments later, lightening drove the players from the ground. Time is ticking away now and, with just two days to go, it would take something remarkable for the South Africans to win the match from here. But England\\'s fallibility, and their growing tendency to allow the opposition a second chance is something that should concern their supporters. Everyone is anticipating a close, exciting Ashes series in the summer. But, being completely honest, England will have to improve enormously on their efforts on this tour even to come close to threatening the Aussies.\\nRussell to instruct keeper Jones\\n\\nFormer England and Gloucestershire wicket-keeper Jack Russell has been called in to give coaching to current national team gloveman Geraint Jones.\\n\\nJones did not have the best of tours in South Africa, dropping catches and conceding too many byes. Now England coach Duncan Fletcher has sought out the 54-Test veteran. Russell told the Daily Express: \"Duncan and captain Michael Vaughan have asked me to build a relationship with Geraint and give him whatever help he needs.\" The pair have already worked closely but Russell will be heavily involved as the countdown to the Ashes begins. He said: \"Geraint has got the ability to play 100 Tests for England. He has the right attitude.\\n\\n\"People have to remember he is still quite raw. There are some things we need to work out but it\\'s just a case of smoothing out a few rough edges. \"In terms of winning the Ashes, he has got an important role to play. He can do some real damage and I\\'ve no doubt he has the stomach for a fight. Meanwhile, Steve Harmison has reflected on his even more disappointing tour of South Africa. Harmison told the News of the World: \"It was high intensity, high pressure cricket for the whole tour and that\\'s mentally and physically draining. \"It certainly wasn\\'t the best environment in which to hit a bad patch.\"\\nEngland hopeful over Jones\\n\\nEngland are hopeful that Simon Jones will be fit for the Boxing Day Test against South Africa despite going down with a stomach bug.\\n\\nThe Glamorgan paceman left Friday\\'s practice session early to return to the team hotel. \"He\\'s got a slight bug but he had a little bit of a bowl, and I am sure he will be fine for the Test,\" captain Michael Vaughan commented. Jones took 4-39 in the first Test to help England to a seven-wicket victory. And coach Duncan Fletcher hopes he will return to bowling at express pace after a lengthy rehabilitation from a knee injury. Jones has bowled with reduced speed since tearing a cruciate ligament at the start of the 2002/03 Ashes tour. \"Now he\\'s got this confidence he can probably up the speed a little bit,\" Fletcher told BBC Sport. \"And if he can do that we\\'ve got a strong bowling unit there.\"\\n\\nThe Welshman showed glimpses of his former self during the recent one-day series in Zimbabwe. \"There were a few balls he got over 140 [kph - 87.5 mph] where he was just trying himself out,\" Fletcher continued. \"And if he can get back up there he\\'ll be back to being that shock bowler. \"He\\'s hardly played any first-class cricket - he\\'s hardly played any games for Glamorgan, he\\'s only played a few Tests for us.\" Should Jones fail to recover in time for the second Test, Lancashire\\'s James Anderson would be the obvious replacement.\\nEngland need to regroup\\n\\nSouth Africa duly levelled the series in mid-afternoon when England\\'s unlikely top scorer, Steve Harmison, was caught in the gully for 42.\\n\\nEngland now have three days of relaxation in Cape Town in which to contemplate their first defeat in 14 matches before heading to Johannesburg for the fourth Test. Coach Duncan Fletcher\\'s main problem is that only a handful of players are currently pulling their weight. Of the bowlers, Matthew Hoggard is plugging away manfully, but he and Andrew Flintoff appear to be the only seam bowlers Michael Vaughan feels he can trust at present. Simon Jones is bowling steadily enough, yet Vaughan seems to bring him on only as a last resort while Harmison remains a shadow of the bowler who, until this tour, topped the world rankings. Spinner Ashley Giles was more consistent in Cape Town than in the previous Test, but rarely looked threatening. The lack of application of the batsmen, however, has been the principle reason for England having lost their lead. Andrew Strauss and Marcus Trescothick can be excused criticism, but even they would admit that, along with all the others, their wickets have been given away far too easily.\\n\\nWhat must really frustrate Fletcher is that South Africa\\'s bowling attack is little more than workmanlike, and should not have dismissed England for 139 in their first innings in Durban and 163 in the first innings here. On a wearing pitch, they still needed 124 overs to bowl England out a second time, and the last wicket pair of Harmison and Hoggard were able to add 51 with little difficulty. At least the news of Andrew Flintoff\\'s injury is encouraging. An MRI scan revealed that his problem is an abdominal strain, rather than intercostal. Had it been the latter, it would have ended his tour at a stroke, but the belief now is that, with treatment, he should be fit to bowl in Johannesburg. If the injury does not recover in time, England face the nightmare of trying to choose a balanced team. Mark Butcher\\'s prognosis does not appear to be as promising. He is wearing a cast on his left wrist which will be removed next week, but time seems to be running out for him. Neutral observers still believe that England are the better team, but having avoided defeat in Durban and scored a resounding victory here, South Africa now have the force with them.\\nKenya cricket boss fights sacking\\n\\nKenya Cricket Association president Sharad Ghai has obtained a court order preventing his dismissal by the government over financial allegations.\\n\\nGhai was accused of failing to account for sponsorship money, resolve player disputes or hold regular elections. Sports Minister Ochillo Ayacko has appointed a caretaker committee, headed by Issac Kalua, to serve for three months before new elections take place. But the order prevents Kalua moving in for 21 days, pending a judicial review. Ghai insisted his committee had always submitted receipts and audited accounts of its expenditure.\\n\\nHe has refused to hand over the office keys to Kalua and was angered when the interim committee broke into the building under police supervision. \"What we are saying is that this should have been done ina dignified manner,\" he protested. \"There was supposed to be a date and time set for office handover, and this is what is expected to happen in any civil society.\" It is not the first time the government has made accusations of financial mismanagement against the board. In 2002 they disbanded the committee, but a court reinstated the officials.\\nAuckland set forTwenty20\\n\\nTwenty20 International, Auckland\\n\\nNew Zealand v Australia (Starts Thursday 0600 GMT)\\n\\nThe Black Caps will be without injured Daniel Vettori, though he is likely to play in Saturday\\'s first match of the 50-over one-day series. Former rugby union international Jeff Wilson is included in the 12-man squad for the historic encounter. Australia were given a boost when Matthew Hayden overcame a pleurisy scare to be available for all matches. Double All Black Wilson, who returns to the international line up after a 12-year lay-off, said it was no secret Australia were viewed as being the toughest opponents the Black Caps could face. \"The Aussies are the world\\'s premier team, but we\\'re a pretty accomplished one-day side too, and I\\'m looking forward to being a part of the challenge,\" said Wilson. \"As a team, we are under no illusions about how tough it will be or how good they are, but it\\'s simply a matter of playing consistently well against them and grabbing all our chances.\" Although the tour focus remains firmly fixed on the opening one-day international, New Zealand coach John Bracewell said the Twenty20 match was a good opportunity to have an early \"sighter\" of each other.\\n\\n\"The Twenty20 match might be a chance to get first psychological points with a long series ahead,\" said Bracewell. Statistics may favour New Zealand, who have not lost a home series in four years, but statistics count for nothing compared to current form where Australia have an aura of invincibility. Australia, meanwhile, flew out of Sydney on Wednesday for the tour, dismissing suggestions they already have their minds on the Ashes series in England this summer. The tour is Australia\\'s final workout ahead of the Ashes trip and while England are looming as a potentially greater threat, captain Ricky Ponting said his team were only worried about New Zealand. \"I think a lot of the media are talking about the Ashes series, but we know that we have got this very big and vital series to play first,\" said Ponting. \"New Zealand are a very good side and they are hard to beat in in Australia and a lot harder to beat over there.\"\\n\\nS Fleming (cpt).

An ICC statement said Harbhajan\\'s orthodox off-break and doosra now fell \"within the tolerance threshold\". He was reported to the ICC by match referee Chris Broad after a Test in Bangladesh last December. As a result, he underwent tests supervised by biomechanics expert Bruce Elliott of the University of Western Australia last month, who reported back to a panel of experts set up by the Indian board. They passed his findings on to the ICC, who will now circulated them to all members of the elite panel of umpires and match referees. Harbhajan, whose action first came under scrutiny in 1998, has taken 189 Test wickets and claimed 117 victims in one-day internationals. Elliott said he was confident he had bowled with a similar intensity to that of Test matches during the camera test. \"We can make a comparison to the video from the match when he was reported - things such as ball speed, arm rotation, position of the body and technique,\" he explained. \"We had two arbiters in Daryl Foster and Harbhajan himself to give a ranking to each delivery so that we were confident they were quality deliveries.\"\\nIreland happy with new C&G format\\n\\nIreland will be guaranteed nine C&G Trophy matches from 2006 when the competition changes from straight knock-out to a league format.\\n\\nAnd skipper Jason Molins said the new structure was a great boost to the development of Irish cricket. \"It is something we have been pushing for. We need to play more often as a unit and against better opposition,\" said the Irish captain. \"The opportunity to play this sort of cricket is really exciting.\" The new competition will be played in the first half of the season, apart from the final, and Ireland will be in the Southern Conference with nine first-class counties.\\n\\nScotland have been invited to take part in the Northern section. \"World cricket at the moment is eight or nine tams playing one-day internationals,\" added Molins. \"If Ireland want to aspire to that level we have got to be playing more one-day matches against good teams. \"Irish cricket has invested heavily in a national coach and chief executive. We need to be playing more games. \"Ireland have a lot of young players coming through and this will help give them a platform and more profile.\"\\n\\n- As part of Ireland&#191;s preparation for the ICC Trophy in July , the Irish Cricket Union have secured a fixture against the current English county champions Warwickshire. The match will be played at Edgbaston on Sunday 24 April.\\nVaughan endures day to forget\\n\\nThis was England\\'s worst day for a long time, and was capped by captain Michael Vaughan being fined 100% of his match fee.\\n\\nMatch referee Clive Lloyd\\'s decision followed criticism from Vaughan of the umpires\\' handling of the bad light decisions on the second day.\\n\\nThe bowling throughout the day was awful and, two balls from the close, Geraint Jones dived directly in front of Marcus Trescothick at first slip and dropped Herschelle Gibbs on 136. Having declared, and sacrificed the possibility of reaching a century, Michael Vaughan must have been horrified by the manner in which his bowlers responded. Briefly the conditions were ideal, with low cloud hanging over the ground, and although this was soon replaced by clear blue sky which made batting easier, the direction of Steve Harmison in particular was woeful. His first eight overs conceded only nine runs, simply because the batsmen could not reach the ball. Far too many deliveries went down the leg-side and even Matthew Hoggard was below his best, four wickets notwithstanding.\\n\\nUnderstandably James Anderson was rusty having not played a match since 4 December but Harmison\\'s day was made complete when he hobbled off with a calf strain. Graeme Smith and Gibbs got away to a flier but were separated in the 16th over when Smith was trapped lbw to Hoggard for 29. This has been a disappointing series so far for the South African captain and his demise was all the more embarrassing because he fell over and was flat on the ground when umpire Bucknor finally raised his painfully slow finger. The bowling was still erratic, but Hoggard struck again six overs later when Rudolph laced a wide half volley to gully where Ashley Giles took a stinging catch that dislocated his right thumb.\\n\\nJacques Kallis again looked very well set, and the stand with Gibbs during the afternoon was looking ominous until Hoggard found some extra bounce and Kallis, aiming to force off the back foot, chopped the ball into his stumps for 33. Boeta Dippenaar is one of the least exciting batsmen currently in Test cricket, and after 37 minutes, he fell to a low catch at slip for a duck. The ball was so low to the ground when Trescothick took it that Dippenaar was reluctant to go. TV replays - which are only used now when the umpires are unsighted - would probably have given the batsman the benefit of the doubt, but Mr Dar sent him on his way to a chorus of boos from the crowd. AB DeVilliers joined Gibbs, who was now strangely becalmed and only 65 runs were scored in the afternoon session, but after DeVilliers hooked Hoggard and was caught at long leg for 19, Gibbs reached his 14th century in almost five and a half hours. The second new ball failed to force an immediate breakthrough as Gibbs and Boucher launched a counter attack and added 120 crucial runs before Boucher was caught at point for 64.\\nCricket coach moves on after tsunami\\n\\nWhen the tsunami crashed onto the Sri Lankan coastline, cricket coach Stephen Jones was in the middle of catching practice.\\n\\nWithin minutes the entire playing area at the Galle stadium was covered by water, but Jones and the boys of the Harrow School team made it to safety just in time. Thousands were not so lucky and now, almost a month later, Jones is still coming to terms with the experience. But he must do so whilst concentrating on his next coaching assignment to prepare the South African team for the Women\\'s World Cup, starting in March. Jones admits his memory of events in Galle is still \"a blur\". He told BBC Sport: \"We were about half an hour from starting our game and were warming up. \"Fortunately we were doing fielding drills right in front of the pavilion - had we been doing them anywhere else on the field we would have been in trouble. \"I remember the level of noise going up and a colleague\\'s wife and daughter screamed at us to watch out. I was told, and this I don\\'t remember, that one of the locals came up to me and told me to get off the field. \"It probably took only five minutes, maybe 10 minutes, for the water to get to about five metres deep.\"\\n\\nThe Harrow party took refuge in a viewing area next to the changing rooms which proved high enough. \"The boys were terrified - we were all terrified - but they were [also] amazingly calm,\" said Jones. \"I thought afterwards that if one of them had panicked it might just have set off a domino effect and we could have been in trouble. \"If it had happened at the beginning of the tour it might have been different, but I think the fact that we had been around together as a team counted in our favour - the team ethic of looking out for each other really came to the fore.\" The 49-year-old from Cape Town believes his perspective on life has changed. But he is conscious of the significance of the Women\\'s World Cup, which South Africa is hosting, and the need to do his utmost to focus fully on helping a team which has not played international cricket for a year.\\n\\n\"I\\'m aware of the fact that perhaps women\\'s cricket here is a little bit more in its infancy than in other countries, there\\'s a little bit further to go. \"This World Cup is critical. If it\\'s a success and gets the exposure I hope it does, it can elevate women\\'s cricket here to a brand new level,\" he said. \"Perhaps I\\'m going to be a bit more relaxed about it than I might have been and see it in its bigger context, see the bigger picture. \"But it\\'s nice to achieve things as well and it\\'s important for the girls to make a good go of it, and make it a special occasion.\"\\nECB defends England tour schedule\\n\\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board has defended its role in the scheduling of the tour to South Africa.\\n\\nCriticism of the itinerary intensified after England\\'s defeat in Cape Town, the last of three back to back Tests. ECB director of cricket operations John Carr said: \"We raised our eyebrows when he received the first draft from the South African Board. \"Unfortunately, South Africa have got an incredibly condensed programme from last November to the end of May.\" South Africa toured India prior to England\\'s arrival and will follow their departure with series against Zimbabwe and West Indies. \"We need to play seven Test matches and 10 one-day internationals during the course of the home programme to generate the revenue that helps fund all of English cricket. \"We are expected to reciprocate a similar amount of cricket over the winter months.\\n\\n\"Most years we manage that workload in a more acceptable way in terms of when the cricket is played. \"It just so happens that the logistics of international cricket at the moment, and South Africa\\'s programme in particular, meant ther whole of our tour had to be condensed into a very narrow period. \"We weren\\'t in a position to demand a reduction in the number of Test matches or one-day internationals,\" explained Carr. He acknowledged the schedule was \"far from ideal\" for the players and said the subject of their workload was \"troubling\" the various boards around the world. \"We have to hold our hands up, along with the South African board, and say that this winter it hasn\\'t been a satisfactory situation,\" Carr added.\\n\\nFormer England opening batsman Geoffrey Boycott described playing three Tests back to back as \"madness\" and said Carr and England coach Duncan Fletcher should never have agreed to it. But Graham Thorpe, at 35 the oldest member of the England Test squad, told the BBC there was no point in complaining about the schedule. \"Three Test matches in three and a half weeks is a tough schedule, there\\'s no doubt about that,\" he said. \"In the first half of my career I\\'d go on tour and for four or five weeks and I wouldn\\'t do anything bar playing a couple of warm-up games. \"This is very different, we\\'re basically playing five Test matches with no games in between. That\\'s the way modern tours are now. \"It\\'s exciting. The games come thick and fast but there\\'s very little time to find your form. \"It\\'s just a case of having to get on with it. We all knew how the tour was scheduled. \"It\\'s one all after three Test matches. We\\'ve taken a beating in Cape Town but there\\'s no reason to be too down about it. These things happen in sport.\"\\nRain holds up England\\n\\nFifth Test, Centurion. South Africa v England\\n\\nStart delayed, rain\\n\\nEngland lead the series 2-1 with just this final Test remaining so South Africa desperately need to win. The officials had hoped play could get under way at noon local time but a further downpour led to an early lunch being taken by the players. For England, Simon Jones is expected to replace James Anderson while the hosts play both Andrew Hall and Andre Nel, with batsman Boeta Dippenaar dropped. Dale Steyn had already been released from the squad for Centurion and it means South Africa go in with five seamers and one spin bowler.\\n\\nOn Friday, England captain Michael Vaughan had said it was important his team targeted victory and not simply a draw. He said: \"You can\\'t set out over five days to draw a game. We have to try to win. If you go out in a mindset to draw you don\\'t have the right attitude. \"We\\'ll just set out in a positive manner and try to put the South Africans under a lot of pressure.\" England, who have not won a series in South Africa for 40 years, will play on a green pitch which has endured a long spell of wet and humid weather. The weather forecast for Saturday onwards is fine, and early starts on all four days from then could ensure there is plenty of time to achieve a result.\\n\\nMiddlesex opener Andrew Strauss, with a stunning aggregate of 612 runs in the four Tests played to date, said South Africa had every incentive to throw caution to the wind. He said: \"It\\'s been a great series for me. It\\'s been very satisfying. \"But I think we all realise that this last game is very important and we can\\'t afford to take our foot off the pedal now. \"Sometimes when you\\'ve got a lead it\\'s quite hard to keep yourself motivated.\\n\\n\"We are pretty sure that the South Africans will come back hard at us. They have a lot of motivation to do well against us this week.\" South Africa captain Graeme Smith said the colour of the pitch was probably misleading. He said: \"The pitch has played pretty well all year. It might look a bit juicy but will probably play pretty good.\" He added that his team had the capability of bouncing back. \"We came back in New Zealand from 1-0 down to level the series in Wellington so we\\'ve been in this situation before. \"We\\'ve just got to play some really good cricket for four to five days. We\\'ve had had a lot of iffy performances so far. \"With a bit of luck here or there or playing some better cricket at certain times it could have easily been the other way round. \"It\\'s been that sort of series, ebb and flow, and I\\'m sure it\\'s going to be that way again.\"\\n\\nGraeme Smith (capt.), Herschelle Gibbs, Jacques Rudolph, Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers, Mark Boucher (wkt), Andrew Hall, Nicky Boje, Shaun Pollock, Makhaya Ntini, Andre Nel.\\n\\nMarcus Trescothick, Andrew Strauss, Robert Key, Michael Vaughan (capt.), Graham Thorpe, Andrew Flintoff, Geraint Jones (wkt), Ashley Giles, Matthew Hoggard, Steve Harmison, Simon Jones.\\nAustralia complete series sweep\\n\\nThird Test, Sydney, day four (result): Australia 568 & 62-1 bt Pakistan 304 & 325\\n\\nPakistan, continuing on 67-1 overnight, posted 325 all out in their second innings and the home team quickly scored the 62 runs needed for victory. Asim Kamal top scored for the visitors with a well-made 87, but Australia were always in control after building a first-innings lead of 264. And on a turning wicket Shane Warne took 4-111 and Stuart MacGill 3-83. Australia took three wickets during the morning session to reduce Pakistan to 172-4, still 92 runs behind the home team\\'s first-innings total. It seemed at one point as though stubborn resistance would limit the visitors to the loss of Yasir Hameed during the first session of the day. But with lunch approaching the Australians swung the balance of the session in their favour with two wickets in two balls. Yousef Youhana was bowled by MacGill for 30 before Younis Khan was trapped lbw to Shane Watson to become the all-rounder\\'s first Test victim.\\n\\nAfter lunch Shahid Afridi was run out after a typically aggressive innings and his dimissal was sparked a fall of five wickets for 32 runs as the Pakistan lower order again threatened to capitulate. At one point they had been reduced to 270-9 after steadily losing wickets throughout the afternoon session. Shortly before the scheduled tea interval Australia claimed the extra half hour as they went in search of victory. But Asim Kamal, partnered by Mohammad Asif, who scored his first runs in Test cricket, put on 55 for the last wicket to set Australia a meagre target for victory. Jason Langer and Matthew Hayden wasted no time in setting about the victory target, thrashing a series of boundaries. With victory just four runs away Langer was bowled sweeping around his legs and new batsman Ricky Ponting smashed the next delivery to the boundary to seal victory.\\n\\nMatthew Hayden, Justin Langer, Ricky Ponting (capt), Damien Martyn, Michael Clarke, Shane Watson, Adam Gilchrist (wkt), Shane Warne, Jason Gillespie, Glenn McGrath, Stuart MacGill.\\n\\nSalman Butt, Imran Farhat, Yasir Hameed, Younis Khan,Yousuf Youhana (capt), Asim Kamal, Kamran Akmal (wkt), Mohammad AsifShoaib Akhtar, Naved-ul-Hasan, Danish Kaneria.

He only played one Championship game in 2004 because of a side injury and has agreed \\'performance related\\' terms with Essex after treatment by a specialist. \"I am determined to repay Essex for the faith they have shown in me. This is a new start for me and I am just itching to get out on the field,\" he said. \"[Essex captain] Ronnie Irani phoned me up after he heard I\\'d been released by Surrey and said he wanted to get me fit. Even if I didn\\'t sign he just wanted to get me back on the cricket field. \"I\\'ve had a spinal problem and Essex put me in touch with some people in Germany and I owe them a lot,\" he added. Tudor is also a useful performer with the bat and became an overnight hero in 1999 when his innings of 99 not out against New Zealand saw England to a Test victory at Edgbaston. He last played for England on the 2002-03 Ashes tour when, ironically, he joined the squad as a replacement for new Essex team-mate Darren Gough. Irani described Tudor as a \"world-class signing\".\\n\\nHe told the club\\'s website: \"He is a role model professional with a first-class attitude who will be a great asset to the team. \"There has obviously been a question mark over Alex\\'s fitness record of late but he has gone to extreme measures in order to get himself back on track. \"If all goes well then hopefully we will be talking about Alex Tudor in the future as an Essex and England player.\" The signing was also welcomed by coach Graham Gooch, who was England manager on Tudor\\'s first tour to Australia in 1998-99. \"I had nothing other than praise for the way he conducted himself - both on the field where he performed well in all three disciplines and in the dressing room,\" said Gooch. \"Alex is an international quality player and good team man who will be well motivated to prove his doubters wrong.\"\\nKaif absence wrong - Azharuddin\\n\\nIndia were wrong to leave Mohammad Kaif out of their squad for the first Test against Pakistan, according to former captain Mohammad Azharuddin.\\n\\nAzharuddin, serving a life ban for match-fixing, feels the middle-order batsman deserves another chance. \"Kaif batted very well against Australia on a tough wicket,\" Azharuddin told BBC Sport. \"He\\'s got a lot of talent and I am sure he cannot be held back. His omission is not good for his confidence.\" Kaif scored two fifties in last year\\'s home series loss to the Aussies, while Yuvraj Singh failed badly against the same opponents yet was given a squad berth for the Mohali Test starting on 8 March.\\n\\nAzharuddin reckons Vangipurappu Laxman should bat at first drop despite struggling for form. \"Laxman has always played well when he has gone as number three,\" he said. \"Lower down the order, a lot of pressure is on him and if I were the captain, I would have played him at number three.\" As well as spinners Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble, India have four pacemen to choose from after naming Ashish Nehra, Lakshmipathy Balaji, Irfan Pathan and Zaheer Khan in the 14-man squad. \"All the four pace bowlers deserve to get into the team,\" Azharuddin added. Pakistan, minus injured paceman Shoaib Akhtar, are due to arrive in India on Monday ahead of their first warm-up match against the Indian Board President\\'s XI starting on Thursday. \"Shoaib Akhtar\\'s absence in the Pakistani side is not going to make much of a difference,\" Azharuddin opined. \"He may get a wicket or two but he has to be more consistent. Also, the Indian batting is very strong now.\"\\n\\nAzharuddin maintains his innocence despite his central involvement in the match-fixing scandal of 2000 which saw Pakistani Salim Malik and the late Hansie Cronje of South Africa also receive life bans. In 99 Tests for India from 1984 to 2000, Azharuddin scored 6,215 runs at an average of 45 with 22 centuries.\\nAussies tighten grip\\n\\nFirst Test, Perth, day three: Australia 381 & 361-5 dec; Pakistan 179 & 18-1 (close)\\n\\nThe home side declared their second innings on 361-5, a lead of 563, and Pakistan were 18-1 at the close. Martyn made no mistake after Ricky Ponting was stumped for 98 and Justin Langer bowled by Abdul Razzaq for 97. Left to survive six overs before the close, Pakistan lost Imran Farhat, who was lbw to Glenn McGrath for one. Pakistan\\'s cause was not helped by the absence of skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq and paceman Shoaib Akhtar for most of the afternoon. Inzamam stayed in the dressing room suffering from a stomach upset, while Shoaib hurt his left shoulder while trying to make a diving save in the field.\\n\\nHe had taken the only wicket to fall during the morning, bowling Matthew Hayden for 10 with an inswinger as Australia advanced their score from 15-0 to 110-1. Langer\\'s fifty arrived off 84 balls and he struck 14 fours as he and Ponting shared a second wicket stand of 163. It looked odds on that he would become the first man ever to make a hundred in each innings of a Test at the Waca when Razzaq found a way through as he attempted to drive.\\n\\nBut Langer, who made 191 in the first innings, is now the highest run scorer in Tests in 2004 with 1,426, including five centuries. Ponting was on 92 at the tea interval and well set to reach three figures for the first time this year. He was denied, however, when he missed an attempted sweep of Danish Kaneria and keeper Kamran Akmal whipped off the bails - a dismissal confirmed by the TV umpire. Darren Lehmann was bowled by Kaneria for five, but Michael Clarke joined Martyn in a stand of 79 for the fifth wicket before he was caught by the revived Inzamam off Mohammad Sami for 27. Martyn reached three figures in the next over, a 121-ball knock featuring 11 boundaries, and Ponting immediately made the declaration. The Pakistan openers walked to the middle under intense pressure and it proved too much for Farhat, who shouldered arms to an inswinging delivery from McGrath. But partner Salman Butt survived to reach stumps on eight not out and Younis Khan drove the day\\'s penultimate delivery from Jason Gillespie through extra cover for four to finish on seven.\\n\\nRicky Ponting (c), Justin Langer, Matthew Hayden, Damien Martyn, Darren Lehmann, Michael Clarke, Adam Gilchrist, Shane Warne, Jason Gillespie, Michael Kasprowicz, Glenn McGrath. 12th man: Brett Lee.\\n\\nInzamam-ul-Haq, Imran Farhat, Salman Butt, Younis Khan, Yousuf Youhanna, Abdul Razzaq, Kamran Akmal, Shoaib Akhtar, Danish Kaneria, Mohammad Sami, Mohammad Khalil. 12th man: Yasir Hameed.\\nLanger century deflates Pakistan\\n\\nFirst Test, Perth, day one (stumps): Australia 357-8 v Pakistan\\n\\nThe local opener steered Australia to 357-8 with 181 not out, a 264-ball knock which included 17 boundaries and three sixes. Langer put on 152 runs for the sixth wicket with Adam Gilchrist (69) after the hosts had slumped to 78-5. Shoaib Akhtar revelled on the pacy pitch to return figures of 4-89. Shoaib and fellow paceman Mohammad Sami (2-94) held sway early on after Pakistan won the toss and inserted Australia. But Langer stood firm throughout the day to wrest back the initiative, displaying rare flair in his 21st Test century and fourth against Pakistan. When he reached 41, Langer passed West Indies skipper Brian Lara (1,178 runs) to become the leading Test run-scorer in 2004. Should he remain unbeaten when Australia\\'s innings finishes on Friday, he will become the 42nd batsman in Test history to carry his bat.\\n\\nShoaib claimed an early victim by trapping Matthew Hayden lbw for four with a rapid, overpitched inswinger. Skipper Ricky Ponting and Langer then put on 50 before Ponting fell to Sami, bowled through the gate playing an expansive off-drive. Sami struck again in his next over to have Damien Martyn caught behind, and when Shoaib removed Darren Lehmann (bowled) and Michael Clarke (caught) cheaply Australia were reeling on 78-5. But Langer found an able ally in vice captain Gilchrist, who took the long handle to the hosts\\' predicament. Gilchrist struck 10 boundaries in his 78-ball stay, helping Australia along to 230 before his stumps were levelled by all-rounder Abdul Razzaq. Razzaq soon accounted for Shane Warne (caught), bringing Jason Gillespie to the crease in what marked the start of another deflating period for Pakistan.\\n\\nGillespie (24 off 69 balls) and Langer put on 80 runs, with Langer finding the middle of the bat on several occasions to punish Pakistan. His brutal on-driven six off Sami late in the day was his best shot, and even Gillespie\\'s departure to Shoaib just before stumps could not raise Pakistan\\'s spirits. Langer\\'s partner at the resumption of play on day two will be Mike Kasprowicz, who was preferred yet again to fast bowler Brett Lee.\\n\\nRicky Ponting (c), Justin Langer, Matthew Hayden, Damien Martyn, Darren Lehmann, Michael Clarke, Adam Gilchrist, Shane Warne, Jason Gillespie, Michael Kasprowicz, Glenn McGrath. 12th man: Brett Lee.\\n\\nInzamam-ul-Haq, Imran Farhat, Salman Butt, Younis Khan, Yousuf Youhanna, Abdul Razzaq, Kamran Akmal, Shoaib Akhtar, Danish Kaneria, Mohammad Sami, Mohammad Khalil. 12th man: Yasir Hameed.\\nButt provides boost for Pakistan\\n\\nTour match, Perth: Pakistan 256-9 (50 overs) v Cricket Australia Chairman\\'s XI\\n\\nHis 135-ball innings included a six and 11 fours and gave his side a lift after their surprise defeat by Western Australia\\'s second XI last week. Medium pacer Mike Hussey proved the most effective bowler for the home side, taking 3-28. Pakistan opted to leave out pacemen Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Sami. They were held back for the four-day game against Western Australia, starting on Thursday - their final warm-up before the first Test. All-rounder Shoaib Malik was also rested after hurting his right arm while playing table football. \"It\\'s nothing serious, though he won\\'t bowl for a couple of days,\" said skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq. The Chairman\\'s XI was led by Justin Langer and included former fast bowler Geoff Lawson, who took 180 Test wickets for Australia between 1980 and 1989.\\n\\nJ Langer (capt), B casson, T Dodemaide, B Edmondson, M Goodwin, M Hussey, G Lawson, M North, C Rogers, L Ronchi, D Thornely, P Worthington.\\n\\nInzamam-ul-Haq (capt), Imran Farhat, Salman Butt, Yasir Hameed, Younis Khan,Yousuf Youhana, Shahid Afridi, Karan Akmal, Naved-ul-Hasan, Mohammad Khalil, Danish Kaneria.\\nStreak set to make return\\n\\nFormer Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak has been recalled to the national squad and is available for Wednesday\\'s final one-day match against South Africa.\\n\\nStreak, who has ended his disagreement with Zimbabwe Cricket, said: \"I\\'m looking forward to getting back. \"Obviously there\\'s an element of concern at not having played at this level for a while, but it\\'s not like I haven\\'t been playing cricket. \"I had a good season at Warwickshire and have been playing club cricket.\" On Sunday, captain Tatenda Taibu said Streak and Andy Blignaut would be considered for the Test series in South Africa starting on 4 March. But now it looks as though - in the case of Streak - a comeback could be even more immediate. And Zimbabwe\\'s team manager Babu Memen said: \"It\\'s very likely that he will play on Wednesday, and he will stay on for the Test series.\" Former captain Streak, 30, was sacked in April 2004 after criticising Zimbabwe Cricket\\'s selection policies. Following Streak\\'s dismissal, 14 white players resigned in protest but Gavin Ewing and Barney Rogers have already returned to the fold and Blignaut and Streak are poised to do likewise.\\n\\nWhen Streak announced he had put aside his differences with ZC on Friday, the board\\'s managing director Ozias Bvute announced: \"Heath is immediately available for selection.\" Now, Streak says he will be happy to play under the new regime, with Taibu as captain. He said: \"I\\'ve always played the best I can whether captain or not. I\\'ll give as much as I can without stepping on Tatenda\\'s toes. I\\'ll be there for him to help and to lend the experience that I\\'ve gained.\" Meanwhile four other rebels - Stuart Carlisle, Trevor Gripper, Neil Ferreira and Charles Coventry - have decided to make themselves available for selection for the A team. A five-match one-day home series for Zimbabwe\\'s second string against Bangladesh A starts on Thursday. Of the remaining rebels, Craig Wishart and Gary Brent have revealed they were not interested in returning, while Ray Price, Sean Ervine, Travis Friend and Grant Flower have opted for county cricket in England. The position of Richard Sims remains unclear.\\nEngland A roll to second victory\\n\\nOne-day tour match, Sharjah: England A v UAE\\n\\nPrior top-scored with 84 as a stand of 100 helped England A to 280 for eight in Sharjah with Solanki making 55 and Michael Powell 42.

His last outing for the national team was in 1993 when he gave up cricket to concentrate on his rugby union career, which came to an end in 2002. \"Now that I have this chance I am looking forward to getting in there and making the most of it,\" said Wilson. Wilson had set his sights on returning to the New Zealand side after resuming domestic first class cricket and team coach John Bracewell has said the one-day matches are a chance for the ex-All Blacks winger to re-establish himself.\\n\\n\"His match turning ability is undoubted and we just need to see if he can step up to this level again,\" said NZ coach Bracewell. \"The selectors have watched Jeff and have no doubt that he is a dynamic cricketer.\" In March 1993, Wilson played four one day international matches against Australia. He scored a match-winning 44 not out in the final game of the series before concentrating on rugby union after making his debut for the All Blacks later that year. Wilson takes the place of fast bowler Ian Butler, who is suffering from a bulging disc in his back. The limited-overs series against a World XI side being led by Australian leg spinner Shane Warne begins in Christchurch on 22 January with the two other matches taking place in Wellington on 24 January and Hamilton on 26 January. More than 9,000 tickets were sold on the first day of them being made available. \"Given the very limited lead-time for these matches, we obviously need the public to respond quickly and today has given us a good start,\" said New Zealand Cricket marketing manager Peter Dwan.\\n\\nStephen Fleming (captain), Nathan Astle, Chris Cairns, Hamish Marshall, Brendon McCullum, Kyle Mills, Jacob Oram, Mathew Sinclair, Scott Styris, Daryl Tuffey, Daniel Vettori, Jeff Wilson.\\nInjured Butcher out of tour\\n\\nMark Butcher has been ruled out of the rest of England\\'s tour of South Africa with a sprained left wrist.\\n\\nAnd Andrew Flintoff has yet to prove his bowling fitness for the fourth Test, which starts on Thursday, after suffering an abdominal muscle tear. Flintoff batted in the nets but will not attempt to bowl until Tuesday and could play solely as a batsman. Butcher will fly home later this week, to be replaced by Ian Bell, who played a single Test last year. \"Mark will see a specialist in Johannesburg and fly home in the next few days,\" said England media manager Dave Clarke. \"He tried to have a bat in the nets this morning but was unable to grip the bat.\" Butcher has endured a year beset by back and neck trouble. \"I have been despondent about things since last summer when I got those injuries, but this feels much worse,\" he said. \"I had been quite hopeful after the swelling had gone down, but there was no chance of me getting through for this match. \"I was struggling with a few throw-downs with tennis balls, and there was no chance I could have played cricket balls without discomfort.\"\\n\\nIf Flintoff cannot bowl, England could call seamer James Anderson into the XI at the expense of spinner Ashley Giles, or include Paul Collingwood, a batsman who bowls medium-pace. That could mean Robert Key, who replaced Butcher for the third Test, missing out. England had two days off in Cape Town after the 196-run defeat, their first Test reverse since December 2003, before flying to Johannesburg on Sunday. Meanwhile Michael Vaughan has revealed he is considering sending another member of the team to the pre-match coin toss. Vaughan has won just six of 22 tosses as skipper. \"I can designate someone else to go out there if I want to,\" said Vaughan. \"I\\'m giving it some thought because no-one can do worse than me.\"\\nBatsman Law gains UK citizenship\\n\\nAustralian-born batsman Stuart Law has been granted British citizenship and will be able to play for Lancashire as a non-overseas player in 2005.\\n\\nHe has played domestic cricket in England for the past nine seasons - six with Essex and three with Lancashire. Law said: \"I\\'m glad that it\\'s happened quickly and with no problems. Hopefully it will benefit Lancashire.\" Law could in theory play for England\\'s Test side but he is now 36 and his selection could be a backward step. That said, his record of 23,000 first-class runs, with 68 centuries and at an average of 51.21, could make him a Test candidate if there is an injury crisis.\\n\\nAnd last April England\\'s chairman of selectors David Graveney said: \"We deal in runs and wickets and he is doing nothing wrong in that respect.\" Law played just one Test for Australia, against Sri Lanka, when he scored an unbeaten half century in his only innings. He also appeared in 54 one-day internationals.\\nPakistan urged to show more fight\\n\\nThe head of the Pakistan Cricket Board has warned the national team they are playing for their places in the two remaining Tests in Australia.\\n\\nPakistan suffered a 491-run thrashing in Perth, where they were bowled out for just 72 in their second innings. \"Pakistan is a proud cricket nation and we want some continuity in the team. \"But if the current lot can\\'t pick themselves up we will look at our reserve talent for future tours,\" said PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan. \"We know that under new coach Bob Woolmer, the players need time to adjust to a new system and method. \"But we at least expect them to put up a good fight,\" he added.\\n\\nA crowd of about 150, meanwhile burnt effigies of Woolmer, captain Inzamam-ul-Haq, vice-captain Yousuf Youhana and chief selector Wasim Bari in Karachi on Tuesday. And former coach Javed Miandad has renewed his criticism of Woolmer, who took charge of the team only six months ago. \"The team has some talented players and all they need is to make minor adjustments to their techniques and play with heart on Australian wickets. \"But I think the coach also needs to stop blaming the players and making excuses for every poor performance. \"Woolmer is a highly regarded coach and he needs to back his players and give them confidence at all times.\" Pakistan have lost four of the six Tests they have played so far this year. The second Test against Australia begins in Melbourne on Sunday.\\nSouth Africa sweep top awards\\n\\nSouth Africa\\'s Schalk Burger was named player of the year as the Tri-Nations champions swept the top honours at the International Rugby Board\\'s awards.\\n\\nThe flanker topped a list which included Ireland star Gordon D\\'Arcy and Australian sensation Matt Giteau. Jake White claimed the coaching award while his side held off Grand Slam winners France to take the team award. England player Simon Amor beat team-mate Ben Gollings and Argentine Lucio Lopez Fleming to win the sevens award. Burger\\'s award came just a week after he won the equivalent prize from his fellow international players and White, who also coached Burger at under-21 level, paid tribute to him. \"Schalk\\'s emergence as a major force has meant a lot to South African rugby, but has also influenced world rugby,\" said White. \"He\\'s become to South African rugby what Jonty Rhodes was to South African cricket. It\\'s amazing what he has achieved in such a short time so far in his international career.\" Amor, who will captain England in this season\\'s opening IRB Sevens tournament, the Dubai Sevens, which start on Thursday, was delighted with his award. \"There are so many great sevens players on the circuit at the moment that this is a genuine honour,\" said the Gloucester fly-half.\\nThomas out of Six Nations\\n\\nWales captain Gareth Thomas has been ruled out of the rest of the Six Nations with a broken thumb.\\n\\nThe full-back will have surgery on Monday after fracturing his thumb in the 24-18 win over France on Saturday. But Welsh legend Phil Bennett insisted Wales can cope without Thomas as they chase a first Grand Slam in 27 years. Bennett told BBC Sport: \"Such is the spirit in the camp, they\\'ll put Kevin Morgan at 15, Rhys Williams at wing and just carry on.\" Thomas will miss the match against Scotland on 13 March, and what promises to be a huge encounter against the Irish six days later. Bennett added: \"It\\'s a setback. He\\'s a great captain, he leads from the front and the boys love him.\" Thomas was replaced at half-time by Williams as his side turned around a 15-6 deficit in Paris.\\n\\n\"With Gareth missing I would think Michael Owen will be our captain,\" said Wales coach Mike Ruddock. \"He did a great job in the second half in France. He has been vice-captain all along throughout the championship.\" Wales travel to Edinburgh to take on Scotland in a fortnight and then host Ireland in Cardiff in the final round of matches in what could be the Grand Slam and championship decider. Bennett, an inspirational fly-half for Llanelli and Wales in the 1970s, insisted the national team were entering a new golden period. \"It was a great game and a magnificent result for Wales,\" Bennett told BBC Radio Five Live\\'s Sportsweek programme.\\n\\n\"The way this young team are blending, the glory days are on their way back. \"We couldn\\'t get possession early on and France dominated and scored two tries. \"Had they been ruthless, Wales could have gone into the interval 30 points down. But they didn\\'t take their chances. \"Wales defended fairly well but you cannot give that sort of quality ball to good sides. \"The All Blacks would have been ruthless and buried us in the first half. But the character we showed in the second half was quite outstanding.\"\\nO\\'Sullivan keeps his powder dry\\n\\nWhen you are gunning for glory and ultimate success keeping the gunpowder dry is essential.\\n\\nIreland coach Eddie O\\'Sullivan appears to have done that quite successfully in the run-up to this season\\'s Six Nations Championship. He decreed after the 2003 World Cup that players should have a decent conditioning period during the year. That became a reality at the end of last summer with a 10-week period at the start of the this season. It may have annoyed his Scottish, and in particularly Welsh, cousins who huffed and puffed at the disrespect apparently shown to the Celtic League. We will say nothing of Mike Ruddock \\'\\'poaching\\'\\' eight of the Dragons side that faced Leinster on Sunday. But, like O\\'Sullivan, he was well within his rights, particularly when you are talking about the national side and pride that goes along with it. The IRFU has thrown their weight behind O\\'Sullivan, who must be glad that in the main, there is centrally-controlled contracts. Bar Keith Gleeson who is just returning from a broken leg, everyone of O\\'Sullivan\\'s squad is fit, fresh and standing at the oche ready to launch this season\\'s campaign.\\n\\nBut I doubt whether O\\'Sullivan is going to gloat about the handling of his players. He is not that sort of person. However, he may look at the overworked and injury-hit England, Wales and France squads whose players have been overworked, and then pat himself on the back for his foresight. But there is still the question of turning up and transferring that freshness into positive results when the referee signals the start of the game. Already Ireland are being earmarked as hot favourites in many quarters to go the whole hog this season. A first Grand Slam since Karl Mullen\\'s led the team to a clean sweep in 1948. With England and France visiting Lansdowne Road for the last time before the old darling is pulled down, everything looks perfectly placed. But in the days of yore that frightened the life out of any Irishman.\\n\\nUnder the burden of great expectations, Ireland have crumpled. Take the Triple Crown-winning side of 1985 under Mick Doyle. They were expected to up the ante further for a Grand Slam, only the second in Ireland\\'s history. What happened in 1986? Whitewashed. You see, Ireland, in any sport, love to be downsized. Then they can go out and prove a point to the contrary. It is the nature of the beast. But O\\'Sullivan\\'s side are very capable of proving a salient point this season. After their first Triple Crown for 19 years, they can live up to their success and take a further step up the ladder. O\\'Sullivan has kept faith and displayed loyalty to his players, and they have repaid him in spades ... and there is more to come. He has some old dogs in his squad, but he will come to this season\\'s championship with a different box of tricks, and a new verve to succeed. Ireland can indeed succeed, but just whisper it.\\nCalder fears for Scottish rugby\\n\\nFormer Scotland international Finlay Calder fears civil war at the SRU could seriously hamper his country\\'s RBS Six Nations campaign.\\n\\nFour members of the executive board, including the chairman, David Mackay, have resigned after a simmering row. And Calder said: \"This is terrible news for every level of Scottish rugby. \"David is a successful businessman and I thought that if anybody could transform the negative atmosphere and rising debt level, it was him.\" Mackay\\'s executive board has been in a power struggle with the general committee, which contains members elected by Scotland\\'s club sides. \"He has been driven out by people who seem happier waging civil war than addressing the central issue that professional rugby can\\'t be run by amateurs,\" said Calder.\\n\\n\"In fact, I don\\'t understand why we are still having this argument 10 years after professionalism arrived. \"But I don\\'t believe the rest of the SRU will take this lying down. \"I think the banks will be dismayed at this decision and, ultimately, it is them who pull the strings. \"So I wouldn\\'t be surprised if they reviewed their position. But, in the wider picture, what message does this send out?\" He thought the work of Scotland\\'s coaches, who have been attempting to arrest the decline of the national side, would be made much more difficult. \"Matt Williams and Willie Anderson must be wondering, \\'what have we walked into here?\\'\" said Calder. \"And we can now expect weeks of arguments and acrimony just at a time when we should be looking forward to the Six Nations Championship. \"I am very, very disappointed, more than you can imagine. Why do so many Scots have this knack of turning on each other when the going gets tough?\"\\nMurphy: That was a bruising battle\\n\\nThat\\'s what I call a tough game. It was very physical and fair play to the Italians they made us work very hard for our victory.\\n\\nTheir organisation was very, very good and they proved again that they are getting better and better as the years go by. It is by far the strongest Italian team that we have faced. We knew all along that we would be a huge threat particularly the first game in the Championship. It was not like the days gone by when you could get scores on the board early. We had to work our socks off and try and build our scores gradually. It was really hard work out there and the players have plenty of bumps and bruises to prove it. I\\'m not too bad, but there are one or two others who will be feeling it a bit on Monday morning. In the backs, we were not frustrated at such, but the new rucking laws were a little bit problematical. The different interpretations between the referee and the players was a little difficult. But we managed to get the ball in our hands and I got a try near the end of the first half. It\\'s always good to score. It was great work by Brian and I always knew I had scored even though it went upstairs to the video referee. Eddie (O\\'Sullivan) was very calm at half-time even though we were only 8-6 ahead. He spelled out what we needed to do and advocated getting the ball out of our own territory.\\n\\nThat new ruck law made it a bit more difficult to get out of our own half. We were penalised a lot at the breakdown, and if they had kicked all their chances at goal we would have been behind at the break. So really we went back to playing a territory game and simplifying things and having more patience on the ball. Every one was a little down after the game following the injuries to Brian and Gordon. As yet we do not know the full extent of the injuries, but it does not that good. Now we have to focus on Scotland and only six days to recover. It\\'s a big ask after such a bruising encounter. I was very impressed the way the Scots played against the French on Saturday. It could so easily have gone their way but for a couple of decisions. We will be under no illusions it is going to be tough for us. In the meantime, when in Rome ... .\\nLions blow to World Cup winners\\n\\nBritish and Irish Lions coach Clive Woodward says he is unlikely to select any players not involved in next year\\'s RBS Six Nations Championship.\\n\\nWorld Cup winners Lawrence Dallaglio, Neil Back and Martin Johnson had all been thought to be in the frame for next summer\\'s tour to New Zealand. \"I don\\'t think you can ever say never,\" said Woodward. \"But I would have to have a compulsive reason to pick any player who is not available to international rugby.\" Dallaglio, Back and Johnson have all retired from international rugby over the last 12 months but continue to star for their club sides. But Woodward added: \"The key thing that I want to stress is that I intend to use the Six Nations and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark. \"My job, along with all the other senior representatives, is to make sure that we pick the strongest possible team. \"If you are not playing international rugby then it\\'s still a step up to Test rugby. It\\'s definitely a disadvantage.\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s absolutely critical and with the history of the Lions we have got to take players playing for the four countries.\" Woodward also revealed that the race for the captaincy was still wide open. \"It is an open book,\" he said. \"There are some outstanding candidates from all four countries.\" And following the All Blacks\\' impressive displays in Europe in recent weeks, including a 45-6 humiliation of France, Woodward believes the three-test series in New Zealand will provide the ultimate rugby challenge. \"Their performance in particular against France was simply awesome,\" said the Lions coach. \"Certain things have been suggested about the potency of their front five, but they\\'re a very powerful unit.\" With his customary thoroughness, Woodward revealed he had taken soundings from Australia coach Eddie Jones and Jake White of South Africa following their tour matches in Britain and Ireland.\\n\\nAs a result, Woodward stressed his Lions group might not be dominated by players from England and Ireland and held out hope for the struggling Scots. \"Scotland\\'s recent results have not been that impressive but there have been some excellent individual performances. \"Eddie in particular told me how tough they had made it for Australia and I will take on board their opinions.\" And Scotland forward Simon Taylor looks certain to get the call, provided he recovers from knee and tendon problems. \"I took lessons from 2001 in that they did make a mistake in taking Lawrence Dallaglio when he wasn\\'t fit and went on the trip. \"Every player has to be looked at on their own merits and Simon Taylor is an outstanding player and I have no doubts that if he gets back to full fitness he will be on the trip. \"I am told he should be back playing by March and he has plenty of time to prove his fitness for the Lions - and there are other players like Richard Hill in the same boat.\"\\nSella wants Michalak recall\\n\\nFormer France centre Philippe Sella believes coach Bernard Laporte must recall Frederic Michalak to give his side any chance of beating Ireland.\\n\\nSella admitted he had been impressed by current fly-half Yann Delaigue in the RBS Six Nations to date. But he told BBC Sport: \"Michalak is the answer both now and for the future. Delaigue deserved his chance but the time has come to bring back Michalak. \"He does have weaknesses but has the all-round game to upset Ireland.\" The 22-year-old Michalak has spent much of the tournament on the bench after Delaigue impressed for Castres early in the season. With Michalak overlooked, the French stuttered to narrow wins over Scotland and then England before ironically playing their best rugby in the defeat to Wales. \"The Wales game was amazing to watch but never did I think the French could lose that game at half-time,\" said Sella.\\n\\n\"Their only mistakes were that they didn\\'t score enough points in the first half and were a little bit less focused in the second... but only a little bit.\" Sella, however, insisted the pressure had eased on the under-fire Laporte, despite the defeat at the Stade de France. \"This season is very important for shaping a team for the 2007 World Cup,\" said Sella, \"which Laporte is doing very well. The French get better every game. \"It\\'s difficult, though, when you change a team and you change your tactics as everything has to gel. \"But he has the players and the talent to take them all the way to World Cup victory. \"As a result, it is important that people give him time. It may not seem good now that we\\'re not winning the Grand Slam but no one will care in two years time if we\\'re world champions.\"\\n\\nThe majority of media criticism centred on the way in which France produced a performance devoid of running rugby in their opening two games. But while Sella admitted he liked the more flowing style employed against Wales, he said \"the win was most important\". \"Winning is all that matters,\" he added. \"Ok, the flair may not have been so good, but the discipline, organisation and defence was there, which are all important ahead of 2007.\" France play what Sella believes is their hardest game of the Six Nations against Ireland in Dublin on Saturday 12 March. The French go into the game as clear underdogs. But Sella added: \"People forget that France can still win the Six Nations and they\\'ll be focused on that. \"But Ireland will be going for even more in front of their home crowd. It\\'s going to be tough.\"\\nLondon Irish 19-33 Wasps\\n\\nWasps made light of the absence of several internationals to sink London Irish with a trio of second-half tries.\\n\\nRob Hoadley returned to haunt his old club at the Madejski Stadium, scoring the opening try in the 43rd minute. Tom Voyce powered through the Irish defence for Wasps\\' second try before Richard Birkett went over unchallenged. Mark van Gisbergen added 18 points. Irish replied with three penalties and a Mark Mapletoft drop goal before Scott Staniforth ran in a consolation try. Barry Everitt, who replaced Mapletoft late in the game, added the conversion to become the fourth Premiership player to reach 1,000 points. He joins Jonny Wilkinson, Tim Stimpson and Paul Grayson in achieving that target. Wasps piled on the pressure in an attempt to grab a fourth try which would have secured them a bonus point, but they were denied by some desperate defending from Irish. Director of rugby Warren Gatland revealed that harsh words at half-time inspired his Wasps side to raise their game after the restart.\\n\\n\"They got a roasting and it was a good second-half performance when they came out and played to instructions,\" he said. Gatland also singled out stand-in flankers Tom Rees and John Hart for special praise. \"They did very well. The back row played some fantastic rugby,\" he added. London Irish coach Gary Gold felt the result exposed his side\\'s lack of consistency.\\n\\nIrish trailed by just two points at the break and Gold said: \"For 55 minutes we lived with the best but we have got to get back for the full 80 minutes.\" Gold will now turn his attention to next week\\'s Powergen Cup semi-final at struggling Leeds. \"We\\'ve got a good chance but with Leeds facing possible relegation they\\'re going to come out firing,\" he added.\\n\\nHorak, Staniforth, Penney, Nordt, Bishop; Mapletoft, Edwards; Hatley, van der Walt, Hardwick; Kennedy, Casey; Gustard, Dawson, Murphy.\\n\\nReplacements: Everitt for Mapletoft (53), Hodgson for Edwards (77), Wheatley for Hatley (71), Paice for van der Walt (60), Strudwick for Kennedy (60), Danaher for Gustard (66), Reid for Murphy (47)\\n\\nVan Gisbergen; Voyce, Erinle, Hoadley, Roberts; King, Richards; Payne, Greening, Dowd; Shaw, Purdy; Hart, Rees, Dallaglio.\\n\\nReplacements: Priscott for Roberts (71), Green for Dowd (71), Skivington for Shaw (71), Birkett for Hart (57), Gotting for Rees (39). Not used: Fury, Brooks\\nBortolami predicts dour contest\\n\\nItaly skipper Marco Bortolami believes Saturday\\'s Six Nations contest against Scotland will be a scrappy encounter.\\n\\nWith both sides looking for their first win of the championship, the third-round game at Murrayfield has been billed as a wooden-spoon decider. And Bortolami feels the Edinburgh contest could end up being a bruising battle of the packs. \"It will not be a pretty game because both teams are desperate to gain their first win,\" said the lock forward. Italy have only recorded three wins since they joined the Six Nations in 2000, but two of those have come against Scotland. This year, Italy opened up with a stubborn display against Ireland but ended up losing 28-17.\\n\\nHowever, they were thoroughly outplayed by an impressive Welsh side in Rome last time out. Now the Italians travel to Edinburgh hoping to claim their first away win in the Six Nations. \"Scotland played extremely well against France in Paris but not so well when Ireland came to Edinburgh,\" said Bortolami. \"We are still very disappointed with our last game against Wales in Rome and we are thoroughly determined to right the wrongs. \"As a nation, our quest is to be respected as a team worthy of a place in this tournament and we can only do this by winning games.\"\\nCampese berates whingeing England\\n\\nFormer Australian wing David Campese has told England to stop whingeing in the wake of their defeat to Ireland.\\n\\nEngland coach Andy Robinson lambasted referee Jonathan Kaplan for costing them the game after disallowing tries from Mark Cueto and Josh Lewsey. But Campese told BBC Sport: \"Robinson is living up to England\\'s reputation as whingeing Poms. \"Stop going on about it as who really cares? They\\'re acting like they\\'re the first team to be cheated of a win.\"\\n\\nEngland are contemplating a complaint to the International Rugby Board after potential \"tries\" by Cueto in the first half and Lewsey late on were ruled out without recourse to the video referee. But Campese added: \"Scotland could have beaten France in the same way, but do you see them whingeing? \"Basically, things didn\\'t go England\\'s way and, in typical fashion, they make more of it when they believe they\\'ve lost unfairly.\"\\n\\nEngland are second bottom in the Six Nations table following defeats by Wales, France and Ireland. But although Campese admitted he was surprised about their current predicament, he insisted England were \"no longer world class\". \"England are beginning to realise that being world champions doesn\\'t mean you deserve to win every game,\" he said. \"They lost a few key players and suddenly everyone\\'s realised the ones on the fringes were not all that good in the first place. \"Added to that, the senior players aren\\'t standing up and they can\\'t do anything when the pressure mounts.\"\\n\\nCampese, a veteran of 101 international caps, said full-back Jason Robinson would now be the sole Englishman in his World XV. Robinson has been blamed for poor leadership in the tournament, while his coach has been castigated for appointing a full-back captain. \"I agree that you can\\'t captain from full-back,\" said Campese. \"You need someone in the thick of the action, and it\\'s very hard to give orders from all the way back there. \"Some people are leaders and some aren\\'t. He\\'s not but there\\'s no one who stands out in England\\'s pack - no clear-cut leaders.\" Campese, though, defended coach Andy Robinson, who he believes was the \"only choice\" after Sir Clive Woodward\\'s resignation.\\n\\nBut he blamed \"a lack of talent in the England camp\" for making the current coach look poor. England face a potential wooden spoon match against Italy on 12 March. And the ex-Wallaby added: \"If England lost that, they\\'d be in bloody turmoil. That said, I don\\'t think they will.\" Campese has tipped Wales to win both the Six Nations and Grand Slam come the end of the tournament. \"It\\'s been a surprising tournament,\" he said, \"and maybe Ireland have a little bit more talent overall. \"But playing at home is a major boost. And the possible Grand Slam decider at the Millennium Stadium will be just too much for the Irish.\"\\nCelts savour Grand Slam prospect\\n\\nThe Six Nations has heralded a new order in northern hemisphere rugby this year and Wales and Ireland rather than traditional big guns France and England face a potential Grand Slam play-off in three weeks\\' time.\\n\\nBut before that game in Cardiff, Wales must get past Scotland at Murrayfield, while Ireland face the not insignificant task of a home fixture with the mercurial French. No-one knows what mood France will be in at Lansdowne Road on 12 March - sublime, as in the first half against Wales, or ridiculous, like in the same period against England at Twickenham. But how the mighty have fallen. England sat on rugby\\'s summit 15 months ago as world champions and 2003 Grand Slam winners. But they have lost nine of their 14 matches since that heady night in Sydney. And they face the ignominy of what could amount to a Wooden Spoon play-off against Italy in a fortnight.\\n\\nEngland are enduring their worst run in the championship since captain Richard Hill was dumped in favour of Mike Harrison after three straight losses in 1987. Coach Andy Robinson, who took over from the successful Sir Clive Woodward in September, has lost a phalanx of World Cup stars. And he is enduring the toughest of teething problems in bedding down his own style with a new team. The same year that England ruled the roost, a woeful Wales lost all five matches in the Six Nations. And they won only two games, against Scotland and Italy, in 2004. Wales\\' most recent championship title was in 1994, and their last Grand Slam success came in 1978 in the era of Gareth Edwards, Phil Bennett, JPR Williams et al.\\n\\nBut Welsh rugby fans remain on permanent tenterhooks for the blossoming of a new golden age. After several false dawns, coach Mike Ruddock may have come up with the team and philosophy to match expectations. The fresh verve is inspired by skipper Gareth Thomas, now out with a broken thumb, accurate kicking from either fly-half Stephen Jones or centre Gavin Henson, a rampant Martyn Williams leading the way up front, and exciting runners in the guise of Henson and Shane Williams. Ireland coach Eddie O\\'Sullivan and captain Brian O\\'Driscoll have got their side buzzing too, and they are close to shedding the \"nearly-men\" tag that has dogged them for the past few years. The men from the Emerald Isle have been Six Nations runners-up for the past two years, to France and England.\\n\\nBut they have not won the title since 1985 and last clinched a Grand Slam in 1948. As for Scotland, they have struggled this decade and the 2004 Wooden Spoon \"winners\" have not been in the top two since they lifted the title in 1999. Italy continue the elusive search for their first Six Nations away win, and can still only account for the scalps of Scotland (twice) and Wales since joining the elite in 2000. Coach John Kirwan is a passionate and dedicated believer in the Azzurri, but is lacking in raw materials. And so to France. Brilliant one minute, inept the next. But the reigning champions could quite easily turn on the style in Dublin and end up winning the title through the back door. Ireland, though, have won three times in their last five meetings. Welsh romantics would probably prefer a glorious victory in the Celtic showdown to crown their Grand Slam. But given that Ireland have beaten Wales in four of their last five meetings, the Welsh legions are likely to be behind Les Bleus on 12 March.\\nKafer quits Saracens\\n\\nSaracens head coach Rod Kafer has resigned from the Premiership club.\\n\\nThe 33-year-old Australian, who replaced Wayne Shelford in August 2003, has decided to stand down after a disappointing start to the season. Saracens have decided to promote from within, with rugby manager Steve Diamond named as Kafer\\'s replacement. \"Following talks about extending my contract, I came to the conclusion that my preference was to seek opportunities elsewhere,\" Kafer said. \"In light of this, chief executive Mark Sinderberry and I have decided that it is in the club\\'s best interests that I stand down as head coach immediately. \"I would like to thank both Mark and the board of directors for their unwavering support during the last 18 months and wish the playing and management staff all the best for the remainder of the season.\" Kafer, who was part of the Australia team that won the World Cup in 1999, has been linked with a move to the new Perth-based Super 14 side. Saracens, the perennial under-achievers in the Premiership, have had a poor start to the season with only four victories in the first 11 league games.\\n\\nDespite finishing third from bottom last season, hopes were high for this campaign but they are currently eighth in the table. However the news of Kafer\\'s decision comes just two days after their convincing 52-6 victory over Parma in the European Challenge Cup. Sinderberry said: \"On behalf of the board of directors, I would like to thank Rod for his efforts over the past 18 months. \"He took over the club at a difficult time and he leaves us in a better position with a more focused coaching and playing structure.\" Diamond is the latest man to be charged with winning Saracens\\' first trophy since the 1998 Tetley\\'s Bitter Cup. He joined the club back in March after a successful three years with Sale. Together with Jim Mallinder, Diamond steered the club to second in the Premiership as well as Parker Pen Shield glory. \"Steve will now take on the role of head coach and will be supported by the existing coaching staff,\" said Sinderberry. \"When Steve was appointed, it was with a view that he would succeed Rod should he take the decision to leave Saracens. \"Steve knows the club and the players and we believe he is the right person to take the role.\"\\nHenson stakes early Lions claim\\n\\nThe Six Nations may be a glittering prize in itself but every player from the four Home Unions will also have one eye on a possible trip to New Zealand with the Lions this summer.\\n\\nThe player who staked the biggest claim for a place in the starting XV over the weekend was Gavin Henson. He\\'s very confident. You just had to listen to his interview afterwards - he beamed with confidence - but although there\\'s an element of arrogance it\\'s good arrogance. He certainly showed some nice touches. He once showed a clean pair of heels to Mathew Tait when he got outside him, his defence was very good and he made some great kicks out of hand. And that\\'s without even mentioning his majestic match-winning penalty. But I think we need to wait and see what happens because he needs to be put to the test. He needs to come up against Brian O\\'Driscoll or a big French midfield. Wales fly-half Stephen Jones was another player who impressed me. He gave good direction, he was very confident and he was a nice general for his side. He showed he can control a game. With Jonny Wilkinson not playing at the moment due to inury the number 10 shirt could be up for grabs and Jones, or maybe even Henson, could make the Lions team at fly-half.\\n\\nJones stuck his hand up and he certainly looks a better bet than Charlie Hodgson after Saturday\\'s game. Some of the Wales forwards surprised me because I thought they would be out-muscled in the tight five. England prop Julian White is a capable player but when it comes down to selection Gethin Jenkins is now going to have the upper hand because he came out on top. However, I still think White and Phil Vickery will be in the frame. Some English players did their cause no harm. I thought Joe Worsley had a solid game and Jason Robinson and Josh Lewsey both did nothing wrong. But it looked too soon for young Mathew Tait and I think it will be a while before we see him again. Despite being written off beforehand several Scots caught my eye against France.\\n\\nTom Smith has been there and done it before, but the likes of Chris Cusiter, Jason White and Ally Hogg all made their mark. Hogg made a couple of good runs while White had a pretty robust game - his defence is right up there. Cusiter looked very lively and he could be a very good option for Lions coach Sir Clive Woodward. The star of Ireland\\'s win over Italy in Rome looks like a certainty to make the starting XV against New Zealand. Brian O\\'Driscoll is a class act. He ran some good lines against Italy, made the breaks and fed his outside backs, although Italy defended man on man which made it easy for him. Gordon D\\'Arcy was unlucky to go off injured early on but I think you could get a Henson, D\\'Arcy, O\\'Driscoll combination in the Lions midfield. Paul O\\'Connell just needs to add a hard edge to his game and Malcolm O\\'Kelly keeps on going and seems to be putting his hand up, while Shane Byrne seems to be a lively character. But they will be a bit worried after the Italian pack drove them off their own ball on Sunday, although I used to play in Italy and I know how difficult it can be. One player who didn\\'t impress me was Wales scrum-half Dwayne Peel. He choked late on in the second half when Wales were trailing. They had good possession and he kicked the ball away - I wouldn\\'t want him as my Lions scrum-half after that.\\nWilliams says he will never quit\\n\\nDefiant Matt Williams says he will not quit as Scotland coach even if his side slump to a new low with defeat by Italy at Murrayfield.\\n\\nThat would leave the Scots as favourites to win the Wooden Spoon for the second year running. \"I have never quit anything in my life, apart from maybe painting the kitchen,\" he told BBC Sport. \"The support we have been given from Murrayfield in my whole time here has been 100%.\" Williams has yet to experience an RBS Six Nations victory after seven attempts and Scotland have lost 12 of their 14 games under his leadership. But he rejected the comparison made in some media sources with Berti Vogts, recently sacked as Scotland football manager after a poor run of results.\\n\\n\"How can a German football coach and an Australian rugby coach have anything in common?\" he asked. \"It is a bizarre analogy. It is so absurd that it borders on the humorous.\" Williams insists that he is revelling in the pressure, despite the possibility of a second Six Nations series without a victory. \"That is not beyond the realms of possibility,\" he admitted. \"There\\'s nothing much between the teams, so we could win the next three games or lose them. \"But I actually really enjoy seeing how you cope with such pressure as a coach. \"It helps the team grow and helps you grow as a coach. \"We could have won in Paris but for the last five minutes and now we have two defeats, but we were confident for those two first games and we are confident we can beat Italy too.\"\\nJohnson rules out Lions tour\\n\\nFormer England captain Martin Johnson will not be touring New Zealand with the Lions this summer.\\n\\nThe 34-year-old will be playing in his own testimonial match against a Jonah Lomu XV on 4 June - the same day as the first game of the Lions tour. Johnson, who retired from the international game last year, has called a news conference on Monday to announce details of the match. The World Cup winner twice skippered the Lions and toured three times. The testimonial match, due to be played at Twickenham, is part of a series of events to mark Johnson\\'s long career with Leicester, England and the Lions. The Lions will play the first of their warm-up matches against the Bay of Plenty on 4 June, in Rotorua.\\n\\nStuart Henry, a member of Johnson\\'s testimonial committee, said: \"It can be taken as a fair assumption that Martin\\'s involvement in the Twickenham fixture will mean he will not be going on the British Lions tour.\" Johnson suggested back in December that it was unlikely he would take part in the 11-match tour. \"If you retire from international rugby, you know what you\\'re getting into - or rather, you know what you\\'re getting out of,\" he said.\\nRobinson wants dual code success\\n\\nEngland rugby union captain Jason Robinson has targeted dual code success over Australia on Saturday.\\n\\nRobinson, a former rugby league international before switching codes in 2000, leads England against Australia at Twickenham at 1430 GMT. And at 1815 GMT, Great Britain\\'s rugby league team take on Australia in the final of the Tri-Nations tournament. \"Beating the Aussies in both games would be a massive achievement, especially for league,\" said Robinson. England have the chance to seal their third autumn international victory after successive wins over Canada and South Africa, as well as gaining revenge for June\\'s 51-15 hammering by the Wallabies. Meanwhile, Great Britain could end 34 years of failure against Australia with victory at Elland Road. Britain have won individual Test matches, but have failed to secure any silverware or win the Ashes (with a series victory) since 1970.\\n\\n\"They have a great opportunity to land a trophy and it would be a massive boost for rugby league in this country if we won,\" said Robinson. \"I know the boys can do it - they\\'ve defeated the Aussies once already in the Tri-Nations.\" But Robinson was not losing sight of the task facing his England side in their final autumn international. \"For us, we\\'ve played two and won two this November,\" he said. \"If we beat Australia it would be the end to a great autumn series for England. If we stumble then we\\'ll be looking back with a few regrets. Robinson also revealed that the union side had sent the Great Britain team a good luck message ahead of the showdown in Leeds. \"We signed a card for them today and will write them an email on Saturday wishing them all the best,\" said Robinson. \"Everyone has signed the card - a lot of the guys watch league and we support them fully. \"Both games will be very tough and hopefully we\\'ll both do well.\"\\nCastaignede fires Laporte warning\\n\\nFormer France fly-half Thomas Castaignede has warned the pressure is mounting on coach Bernard Laporte following their defeat by Wales.\\n\\nFrance suffered a shock loss against the Welsh at the weekend after looking on course for an easy win. Castaignede told BBC Sport: \"The pressure is big on Laporte after a huge loss to New Zealand, a slim win over Scotland and a miracle against England. \"But the French have to get behind him and the team at Lansdowne Road.\" Following victories over South Africa and Australia in November, France were deemed by many to be the world\\'s leading side. But they were then trounced 45-6 by New Zealand and only just beat Scotland after the Scots had a try disallowed in their Six Nations opener. It then took some woeful spot kicking from Charlie Hodgson and Olly Barkley to help them to victory against England at Twickenham. &lt;\\n\\nCastaignede said: \"You can\\'t say any of those results have eased the pressure on Laporte. \"Had England\\'s kickers not been so bad, the position in the Six Nations would be very different now.\" Laporte has been criticised for France\\'s negative tactics in their wins over Scotland and England. But his side played a more free-flowing style against Wales, making a mockery of the opposition\\'s defence in the first half before suffering a shock turnaround in fortunes after the interval. \"All the chat in France has been about how France will play against Ireland,\" said Castaignede ahead of the 12 March tie. \"Everyone wants to see the sort of play we saw against Wales. But everyone also wants a win.\" Castaignede, a veteran of 43 international caps, admitted the French would go in as underdogs against Ireland.\\n\\n\"Going to Ireland is never easy but the way they\\'re playing right now, it\\'s harder than ever,\" said Castaignede. \"They\\'re very experienced and don\\'t often lose at home. They\\'ve got some great forwards and some electric runners on the break.\" Despite praising the Irish he claimed the Welsh had the upper hand in the Six Nations run-in. \"Ireland have such a good pack but Wales are something else on the break,\" he added. \"At the weekend they were simply awesome. As a Frenchman it was disappointing to see, but you had to admire it. \"Their commitment to every cause can make them win this championship.\" The 30-year-old also tipped Yann Delaigue to start ahead of Frederic Michalak at number 10 after an impressive display in Paris last weekend. \"Delaigue played really well and admittedly Michalak played well too,\" said Castaignede. \"I\\'m just glad I\\'m not the one who has to make the decision.\"\\nRobinson answers critics\\n\\nEngland captain Jason Robinson has rubbished suggestions that the world champions are a team in decline.\\n\\nEngland were beaten 11-9 by Wales in their Six Nations opener in Cardiff last week and face current champions France at Twickenham on Sunday. Robinson said: \"We are certainly not on the decline. You lose one game and it doesn\\'t make you a bad team. \"I have no doubt in the players we\\'ve got. We have still got the team to go out and beat anyone on our day.\" England find themselves striving to avoid a third successive championship defeat for the first time since 1987. But full-back Robinson believes the new-look England team can stop the rot against France.\\n\\n\"Last weekend we should have won the game,\" he said. \"But if we can under-perform and lose by only two points then I am sure if we play well this week we will get the win we need. \"We proved that in the autumn - when we put in some excellent performances - and we just need to build on that.\\n\\n\"It was a disappointing start against Wales and we might be down on that. \"But we are certainly not out. We will come out fighting this week.\" Robinson also had words of comfort for 18-year-old Newcastle centre Mathew Tait, who made his international debut against Wales but has been demoted from the squad to face France.\\n\\n\"I have had a word with Mathew,\" said Robinson. \"I still believe in him. He is an outstanding player but we have gone for Olly (Barkley) because of the kicking. \"Mathew has just got to take it on the chin, keep working hard like he is doing and I\\'m sure he will feature in some of the games.\"\\nO\\'Sullivan quick to hail Italians\\n\\nIreland coach Eddie O\\'Sullivan heaped praise on Italy after seeing his side stutter to a 28-17 victory in Rome.\\n\\n\"It was a hell of a tough game,\" said O\\'Sullivan. \"We struggled in the first half because we hadn\\'t the football. \"Italy played really well. They handled the ball well in terms of kicking it, if that\\'s not an oxymoron. \"We said before the game that it might take until 10 minutes from the end for this game to be won, and that\\'s how it turned out.\" Ireland struggled to cope with Italy\\'s fierce start and were indebted to skipper Brian O\\'Driscoll, who set up tries for Geordan Murphy and Peter Stringer. \"We had our first attack in the Italian half after 22 minutes,\" said O\\'Sullivan. \"We had a good return, with three first-half possessions in their half and we scored twice. \"The second half was about spending more time in their half.\" Scrum-half Peter Stringer was also glad that Ireland escaped wtih a victory. \"All credit to them,\" he told BBC Sport. \"We knew it would be tough coming to Rome. They always give us a tough game here and they showed a lot of spirit. \"They had a lot of ball in the first half but we got a few scores when we got into their 22.\"\\nCampbell to be Lions consultant\\n\\nFormer government communications chief Alastair Campbell will act as a media consultant to Sir Clive Woodward\\'s 2005 Lions on their tour to New Zealand.\\n\\nCampbell, who left Downing Street earlier this year, will advise on media strategy before and during the tour. \"I hope I can contribute to the planning and preparation, and to ensuring the media and public get the most out of the tour itself,\" he said. \"I am also looking forward to going out for the later stages of the tour.\" Woodward\\'s decision to call in Prime Minister Tony Blair\\'s former spin doctor springs from the deterioration in media relations on the last Lions tour of Australia in 2001, when New Zealander Graham Henry was the head coach. The furore surrounding the newspaper diaries of Matt Dawson and Austin Healey was compounded by other disillusioned players venting their frustration through the media. \"The Lions is a massive media event,\" said Woodward, who will be the head coach. \"There will be a huge level of interest from the travelling media, the fans that will go out in their thousands and the New Zealand public. \"We need to have the strategy and processes in place to deal with the pressures that will bring. \"[Alastair] will act as an advisor both in the build up to and on the tour itself. His role is to work closely with not only myself but (tour manager) Bill Beaumont, (media manager) Louisa Cheetham and (team manager) Louise Ramsay.\" Campbell is due to resume working for the government in the new year in the build-up to an anticipated May general election. The Lions leave for New Zealand on 24 May, with the first Test match against the All Blacks in Christchurch on 25 June.\\nLions blow to World Cup stars\\n\\nBritish and Irish Lions coach Clive Woodward says he is unlikely to select any players not involved in next year\\'s RBS Six Nations Championship.\\n\\nWorld Cup winners Lawrence Dallaglio, Neil Back and Martin Johnson had all been thought to be in the frame for next summer\\'s tour to New Zealand. \"I don\\'t think you can ever say never,\" said Woodward. \"But I would have to have a compulsive reason to pick any player who is not available to international rugby.\" Dallaglio, Back and Johnson have all retired from international rugby over the last 12 months but continue to star for their club sides. But Woodward added: \"The key thing that I want to stress is that I intend to use the Six Nations and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark. \"My job, along with all the other senior representatives, is to make sure that we pick the strongest possible team. \"If you are not playing international rugby then it\\'s still a step up to Test rugby. It\\'s definitely a disadvantage.\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s absolutely critical and with the history of the Lions we have got to take players playing for the four countries.\" Woodward also revealed that the race for the captaincy was still wide open. \"It is an open book,\" he said. \"There are some outstanding candidates from all four countries.\" And following the All Blacks\\' impressive displays in Europe in recent weeks, including a 45-6 humiliation of France, Woodward believes the three-test series in New Zealand will provide the ultimate rugby challenge. \"Their performance in particular against France was simply awesome,\" said the Lions coach. \"Certain things have been suggested about the potency of their front five, but they\\'re a very powerful unit.\" With his customary thoroughness, Woodward revealed he had taken soundings from Australia coach Eddie Jones and Jake White of South Africa following their tour matches in Britain and Ireland.\\n\\nAs a result, Woodward stressed his Lions group might not be dominated by players from England and Ireland and held out hope for the struggling Scots. \"Scotland\\'s recent results have not been that impressive but there have been some excellent individual performances. \"Eddie in particular told me how tough they had made it for Australia and I will take on board their opinions.\" And Scotland forward Simon Taylor looks certain to get the call, provided he recovers from knee and tendon problems. \"I took lessons from 2001 in that they did make a mistake in taking Lawrence Dallaglio when he wasn\\'t fit and went on the trip. \"Every player has to be looked at on their own merits and Simon Taylor is an outstanding player and I have no doubts that if he gets back to full fitness he will be on the trip. \"I am told he should be back playing by March and he has plenty of time to prove his fitness for the Lions - and there are other players like Richard Hill in the same boat.\"\\nWales critical of clumsy Grewcock\\n\\nWales coach Mike Ruddock says England lock Danny Grewcock needs to review his actions after he kicked Dwayne Peel.\\n\\nTrouble flared at a ruck in the first half of Wales\\' 11-9 win in Cardiff as Grewcock came recklessly over the top with his boot, leaving Peel bloodied. Grewcock was sin-binned with Wales captain Gareth Thomas for retaliation. \"It\\'s up to the citing commissioner,\" said Ruddock. \"I\\'m not saying it\\'s deliberate, but Grewcock did a similar thing for Bath against Leinster.\" Last June Grewcock was banned from rugby for two months for reckless use of a boot in a match against New Zealand.\\n\\nSix years earlier, also in New Zealand, Grewcock became only the second England player to be sent off in Tests. The player himself and his captain Jason Robinson have both said that the clash with Peel was accidental. \"If the ball is at the back of the ruck and I feel I can step over and disrupt it then I will do that,\" said Grewcock. But Ruddock feels that the England man should be more careful. \"The boy himself should look at his actions, it was a clumsy piece of footwork,\" he said. \"He\\'s a great player and I don\\'t want to knock him, we won\\'t be calling for the match commissioner to review the incident. \"I\\'m not going to go too far with the lad. It could just be a clumsy action and Dwayne had just a minor cut. \"The referee\\'s interpretation was that Grewcock was attempting to step over the ruck.\" Ruddock also warned his RBS 6 Nations Championship rivals that his team can make massive improvements. \"We created more opportunities and also squandered them by taking more contact and playing more individually,\" said the coach. \"We\\'ve looked through things on the video debrief and there were definitely a lot of chances that we wasted.\" In the forthcoming games, Ruddock may use penalty hero Gavin Henson as his first-choice kicker in place of Stephen Jones. \"Our first aim was to get Gavin settled into the team, but it\\'s something we\\'ll talk about in selection this week,\" said Ruddock.\\nTindall aiming to earn Lions spot\\n\\nBath and England centre Mike Tindall believes he can make this summer\\'s Lions tour, despite missing most of the season through injury.\\n\\nThe World Cup winner has been out of action since December, having damaged both his shoulder and his foot. But Tindall, who recently signed for Bath\\'s west-country rivals Gloucester, told Rugby Special he would be fit in time for the tour to New Zealand. \"I\\'m aiming to be fit by 18 April and hope I can play from then,\" he said. \"I\\'ve spoken to Sir Clive Woodward and he understands the situation, so I just hope that I can get on the tour.\" The 26-year-old will face stiff competition for those centre places from Brian O\\'Driscoll, Gordon D\\'Arcy and Gavin Henson, and is aware that competition is intense.\\n\\nBut after missing out on the 2001 tour to Australia with a knee injury, Tindall says he will be happy just to have an opportunity to wear the red shirt. \"I\\'m quite laid back about it to be honest - it\\'s quite hard for me to expect to be pushing for a Test spot,\" he said. \"But after what\\'s happened this season at least Clive knows I\\'ll be 100% fresh!\"\\n\\n- For the full interview with Mike Tindall tune into this Sunday\\'s Rugby Special, 2340 on BBC Two\\nParis promise raises Welsh hopes\\n\\nHas there been a better Six Nations match than Saturday\\'s epic in Paris?\\n\\nAnd can the Welsh revival continue all the way to a first Grand Slam since 1978? Those are the two questions occupying not just Wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in Paris. Welsh legend Mervyn Davies, a member of two of three Grand Slam-winning sides of the 1970s, hailed it as \"one of the great performances of the past three decades\". Martyn Williams, Wales\\' two-try scorer on the day, called it \"one of the most surreal games I have ever played in\". A crestfallen France coach, Bernard Laporte, simply observed: \"There was a French half and there was a Welsh half\". And what a half it was for the Red Dragonhood, transforming a 15-6 half-time deficit into an 18-15 lead within five mesmerising minutes of the second period. But while that passage of play showed the swelling self-belief of a side prepared to back its own spirit of adventure, the final quarter told us a whole lot more about this Welsh side. That they recovered from a battering in the first half-hour to first stem the tide before half-time, then reverse it on the resumption, was remarkable enough. But in resisting a seemingly unstoppable wave of French pressure in a nail-biting final five minutes, Wales showed not only their physical attributes but their mental resolve.\\n\\nIn international rugby, any of the top seven sides can beat each other on a given day, but the great sides are those that win the close contests on a consistent basis. England suffered some infamous Six Nations disappointments en route to World Cup glory, the pain of defeat forging bonds that ultimately led to victory when it really mattered. Wales have some way to go before they can be remotely considered in a similar light. But the signs are that players previously on the receiving end are learning how to emerge on the right side of the scoreline. Ten of the 22 on duty on Saturday were also involved when Wales were trounced 33-5 in Paris two years ago. But since they threw off the shackles against New Zealand in the 2003 World Cup, Wales have rediscovered much of what made them a great rugby nation in the first place.\\n\\n\"The confidence in the squad has been building and building since the World Cup and we now have young players who are becoming world class,\" noted coach Mike Ruddock. The likes of Michael Owen, Gethin Jenkins, Dwayne Peel and Gavin Henson are certainly building strong cases for inclusion on this summer\\'s Lions tour to New Zealand. And players like Stephen Jones, Martyn Williams, Shane Williams and Gareth Thomas are proving it is not only the youngsters that are on an upward curve. Jones, after his superb man-of-the-match display, observed that \"we are a very happy camp now\". Ruddock and Thomas can take much of the credit for that, ensuring the tribal and regional divisions that have often scarred Welsh rugby do not extend to the national squad. The\\n\\njoie de vivre\\n\\nso evident in that magical second-half spell in Paris also stems from a style of play that first wooed supporters the world over in the 1970s.\\n\\nIf England had half the innate attacking exuberance Wales have produced in this championship, they would not be contemplating the debris of three consecutive defeats. Similarly, Wales have learnt that style alone does not win matches, and that forward power, mental toughness and good decision-making under pressure are equally important. So on to Murrayfield, where Wales have not won on their last three visits. While the hype in the Principality will go into overdrive, the players will set about the task of beating Scotland. Only then - with the visit of Ireland to finish - can they start thinking about emulating the hallowed players of the 1970s, and writing their own names into Welsh legend.\\nWhite prepared for battle\\n\\nTough-scrummaging prop Julian White is expecting a resurgent Wales to give him a rough ride in England\\'s Six Nations opener in Cardiff on Saturday.\\n\\nThe Leicester tight-head is in the form of his life, making the England number three shirt his own. But he knows Wales will put his technique under immense scrutiny. \"The Welsh scrum is a force to be reckoned with,\" he told BBC Sport. \"They have made a lot of changes for the better over the last few years.\" White is also impressed with the Welsh pack\\'s strength in depth. \"Gethin Jenkins is starting at loose-head for them. He has played a bit at tight-head but I think his favoured position is loose-head and he is very good,\" he added. The 31-year-old has made a massive contribution to the England and Leicester cause of late and is arguably the form tight-head prop in the world.\\n\\nHe destroyed South Africa\\'s Os du Randt in the scrum at Twickenham last autumn to give England the platform for an impressive 32-16 victory. Leicester, who signed White from Bristol when the West Country side were relegated from the Zurich Premiership in the summer of 2003, have also been aided by White\\'s presence this season. The Tigers are sitting pretty at the top of the Premiership table and have also booked their place in the last eight of the Heineken Cup. \"I am pleased with my form,\" he said. \"But my form is helped by the people I play with at Leicester - people like Martin Johnson and Graham Rowntree. \"It\\'s been a good season so far and to be in the starting XV for the first game of the Six Nations is what every player wants. \"I am delighted with the way things have gone but we have to get it right this weekend.\" White is now one of the more experienced members of the England squad which takes to the field on Saturday. Injuries have taken their toll and coach Andy Robinson has been deprived of Richard Hill, Jonny Wilkinson, Martin Corry, Mike Tindall, Will Greenwood and Stuart Abbott.\\n\\nAnd with 27 caps and a World Cup winner\\'s medal to his name, White is now in a position to offer his experience to youngsters such as centres Matthew Tait and Jamie Noon. \"I don\\'t know how much experience a tight-head can give a centre but you are there to give them a pat on the back if things go wrong or to be there if they want to talk in any way,\" he added. \"When I first came into the squad, people like Jason Leonard and Martin Johnson were the first to come over and talk through things and help out.\\n\\n\"It gives you a lot of confidence when people like that speak to you. \"I was in awe of a lot of them so to sit down and speak with them and realise you are on the same wavelength is good.\" White missed the vast majority of last year\\'s Six Nations because of a knee injury and is raring for the 2005 event to get going. And that is despite the opening game taking place amid the red-hot atmosphere in Cardiff. \"I enjoy the atmosphere. The Millennium Stadium is probably one of the best stadiums in the world,\" he said. \"To go down there and hear the shouting and the singing - it\\'s one of my favourite places to play. \"This is probably the most even Six Nations for a long time. England, Ireland, France and Wales are all contenders. \"On form, Ireland should be favourites but you just don\\'t know - that\\'s the great thing about this tournament.\"\\nLeeds v Saracens (Fri)\\n\\nHeadingley\\n\\nFriday, 25 February\\n\\n2000 GMT\\n\\nThe Tykes have brought in Newcastle prop Ed Kalman and Tom McGee from the Borders on loan while fly-half Craig McMullen has joined from Narbonne. Raphael Ibanez is named at hooker for Saracens in one of four changes. Simon Raiwalui and Ben Russell are also selected in the pack while Kevin Sorrell comes in at outside centre.\\n\\n- Friday\\'s game at Headingley got the go-ahead on Friday after passing an early pitch inspection. Leeds: Balshaw; Rees, Christophers, Bell, Doherty; McMullen, Dickens; McGee, Rawlinson, Gerber; Murphy, Palmer (capt), Morgan, Parks, Popham. Replacements: Kalman, Regan, Hyde, Rigney, McMillan, Rock, Vickerman. Saracens: Bartholomeusz; Castaignede, Sorrell, Harris, Vaikona; Jackson, Bracken; Yates, Ibanez, Visagie; Raiwalui, Fullarton; Randell, Russell, Vyvyan (capt). Replacements: Cairns, Lloyd, Broster, Chesney, Johnston, Rauluni, Little.\\nWales hails new superstar\\n\\nOne game into his Six Nations career, and Gavin Henson is already a Welsh legend.\\n\\nA mesmeric display against England, topped off by his howitzer of a match-winning penalty, has secured life membership of that particular club. At 23, Henson has the rugby world at his silver-booted feet. And if his natural self-assurance and swagger is shared by his Wales team-mates, then a full-blown revival could be more than just a lot of hot air drifting up from the Valleys. The \"Red Dragonhood\" subdued the \"Red Rose Army\" in most areas of the field, but Henson\\'s stellar performance ensured their efforts yielded the win they craved above all others. He announced himself in the game\\'s opening salvo with a \"Welcome to Cardiff\" greeting for Mark Cueto on the gain line. And his defence was a major feature of the match, his principal victim poor old, or rather young, Mathew Tait. The England centre will have spent his 19th birthday on Sunday shuddering at the memory of how he was up-ended not just once, but twice, by Henson\\'s all-enveloping tackles.\\n\\nThe second time, after the interval, single-handedly lifted the record Millennium Stadium crowd at a time when England were starting to show menace. Showing awesome strength, Henson nonchantly held the bewildered debutant in mid-air, a master predator toying with his helpless prey, savouring the kill. His kicking game also prospered, particularly when he moved to full-back for 10 minutes either side of half-time when his captain Gareth Thomas was in the sin-bin. One huge clearance from Tait\\'s kick sent England retreating rapidly while another booming punt to the right corner kept the visitors pinned in their own half. Henson was also creativity personified: one little chip ahead for Shane Williams narrowly missed its target; a precise cross-kick forcing Jamie Noon to fumble the ball into touch. He also had a hand in the game\\'s only try, finished superbly by Williams, and might have scored himself on the half-hour as he glided into space, only to be scragged by Tait. Henson was twice repelled as Wales laid siege to the English line after Charlie Hodgson\\'s penalty had edged the visitors in front for the first time. But he was not to be denied as the crescendo rose to a deafening din, and the outcome of the match fell to him. Replacement Gareth Cooper made the most of a poor Welsh scrum by chipping into space, where Jason Robinson was penalised for holding on in the tackle.\\n\\nFive metres in from the right touchline, 44 metres out, it was not a kick Stephen Jones, who had seen a long-range effort fall agonisingly under the bar, would have approached with confidence. \"It was out of Steve\\'s range but I looked at Gavin, and he gave me a reassuring nod,\" said Thomas. Henson, surveying his date with destiny, positively relished the responsibility, and the chance to make himself a hero. Without further ado, he nervelessly slotted the kick that ended five years of English dominance and 12 years of waiting in Cardiff. \"I knew I was going to get it before I even took the kick,\" he said later, his distinct spikey locks freshly gelled into an appropriate star shape. \"I have been getting them from that distance all year so it wasn\\'t a problem.\" There were still four minutes for Wales to hold out, and the frenzy was such that Henson could not even hear Jones shouting instructions at him from three yards away. But it was Wales who finished the game on the attack, almost snatching a second try in a thunderous climax. \"Just Do It\" implored the front page headline on Saturday\\'s Western Mail newspaper. And, thanks to Henson, Wales did.\\nJones happy with Henson heroics\\n\\nWales fly-half Stephen Jones admitted he was happy to hand Gavin Henson responsibility for taking the match-winning kick against England.\\n\\nJones had missed three earlier shots at goal when Wales, 9-8 down, were awarded a long-range penalty with four minutes left in Cardiff. \"I knew the percentages of Gavin reaching it were far higher than me,\" Jones said. \"When he said he wanted it, there were no problems.\" Jones had seen a long-range effort fall a whisker under the crossbar on the hour, before Charlie Hodgson put England in front with 10 minutes left. \"I looked at where it was and I knew I was going to struggle to make it,\" Jones added. \"I said to Gareth (Thomas, the Wales captain) \\'This is touch and go.\\' It was out of my range and obviously Gavin is phenomenal when it comes to distance. He was confident and fancied it. \"There were no questions that he\\'d miss it the way he was playing. He had a superb game.\" Jones was happy to hail Henson\\'s heroic contribution to Wales\\' first win over England in Cardiff since 1993. \"Physically he\\'s a specimen: he\\'s a balanced player, he glides when he runs and obviously he\\'s got a great kicking game as well,\" Jones said.\\n\\n\"His defence was superb, he made some great hits and he had a great game. \"I\\'m glad he\\'s Welsh.\" Victory over England for the first time since 1999 will no doubt fuel expectations of what Wales might achieve in this year\\'s Six Nations. But they now face three away fixtures in Italy, France and Scotland before completing their campaign against Ireland in Cardiff. \"People all over the world want to see Wales back at the top table of world rugby,\" said a proud coach Mike Ruddock. \"But we are not there yet. The next step is finding the consistency to get further wins. \"We have to travel this week and we can\\'t afford to get too giddy about this result. \"We have got to be professional and keep focused on facing Italy.\"\\n\\nNone more so than Henson, who can now expect to have the same sort of spotlight thrust upon him as the likes of Jonny Wilkinson and Brian O\\'Driscoll. The confident 23-year-old is undaunted by the prospect of dealing with such weighty expectations however. \"I\\'m the sort of player who likes pressure on me,\" he said. \"It makes me more concentrated and I think I perform better under more pressure. \"I set a high standard against England and I\\'ve got to back it up next week. \"Two years ago when we played Italy I wasn\\'t involved and we lost, so we\\'ve got to put that right next week.\"\\nLomu relishing return to action\\n\\nFormer All Black star Jonah Lomu says he cannot wait to run out on the pitch for former England rugby union captain Martin Johnson\\'s testimonial on 4 June.\\n\\nThe 29-year-old had a kidney transplant in July 2004 but will play his first full match for three years, leading a southern hemisphere side at Twickenham. \"I actually started training three weeks after my operation but I was very limited until a few months ago. \"Now it\\'s basically bring it on!\" said the giant winger. \"The match on 4 June will be my first 15-man game but I have a training schedule which is quite testing and combines with sevens and a whole lot of things,\" said Lomu. \"I have got so much energy since my operation that I train three times a day, six days a week.\\n\\n\"Mohammed Ali has always been my ideal. Coming back to rugby, people said \\'you are dreaming\\' but it always starts off with a dream. \"It\\'s up to you whether you want to make it a reality.\" Opinion has been divided on whether Lomu should attempt to return to the game after such a major operation. But when Lomu was asked whether he was taking a risk he replied: \"As much as someone going down the road being hit by a bus. \"There are a lot of people in the world with one kidney who just don\\'t know it. \"I have talked this over, had a chat with the donor and this is to set my soul at peace and finish something I started in 1994 [when he made his All Blacks debut].\" At his lowest ebb Lomu was so ill he could barely walk, but he says he is now getting stronger every day and his long-term target is to play for New Zealand again. \"The only person who saw me at my worst was my wife,\" he added. \"I used to take two steps and fall over but now I can run and it is all coming back, and a lot more quickly than I ever thought it would. \"To play for the All Blacks would be the highest honour I could get. That is the long-term goal and you have to start somewhere.\"\\nKoubek suspended after drugs test\\n\\nStefan Koubek says he has been banned for three months by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) after testing positive for a banned substance.\\n\\nThe world number 60 failed a routine drugs test at this year\\'s French Open but now plans to lodge an appeal. Koubek believes an injection given to him by an Austrian doctor to treat a wrist injury is to blame for producing traces of the substance in his system. \"I have acted correctly,\" the 27-year-old Austrian said in a statement. Koubek, who defeated Britain\\'s Greg Rusedski in the decisive rubber of the Davis Cup in September, is now set to miss the start of the season. He said, \"A three-month ban would mean that I not only will miss the Australian Open, but also the Davis Cup in Australia.\"\\nHenin-Hardenne beaten on comeback\\n\\nJustine Henin-Hardenne lost to Elena Dementieva in a comeback exhibition match in Belgium on Sunday for her second defeat in two days.\\n\\nAnd the Belgian, who has slipped to eight in the world after struggling with a virus, faces a tough Australian Open title defence next month. \"I will be heading to Australia with a lot of question marks over me, I know that,\" she said. \"But I think there\\'ll be less pressure than last time even if I am champion.\" Henin-Hardenne was speaking after a 6-2 5-7 6-2 loss to world number six Dementieva in Charleroi, Belgium, on Sunday. The previous day, the Olympic champion went down 6-2 7-5 to France\\'s Nathalie Dechy.\\n\\n\"I have to be positive, I still have a few weeks,\" she said. \"My body has to get accustomed again to the stress, the rhythm.\" Henin-Hardenne slid down the world rankings in the second half of 2004 after contracting the illness in April. After an initial lay-off, she was forced off the circuit for a second time after being knocked out of the French Open in the second round. A comeback at the US Open after a three-month absence ended when she crashed out at the fourth-round stage. But despite her problems, she still won five of the nine official tournaments she entered in 2004 and won Olympic gold in Athens, an achievement which saw her named Belgian sportswoman of the year on Friday. \"Physically, it\\'s obvious that I hit rock bottom,\" said the 22-year-old, who will make her comeback in the Sydney International from 10-16 January. \"Since April, with the exception of the Olympics, I have not done much. \"All the successes I had prior to that were mainly due to the work I put in on building up my fitness. \"Now it\\'s time to get back to putting in 200% effort and I think I am capable of doing that.\"\\nClijsters sets up Venus match-up\\n\\nKim Clijsters continued her comeback from a wrist injury with a 7-5 6-7 6-1 win over Russia\\'s Nadia Petrova in round two of the Antwerp Diamond Games.\\n\\nThe Belgian will meet fellow former world number one Venus Williams in the quarter-finals after the American swept past France\\'s Virginie Razzano 6-3 6-0. Clijsters, sidelined since October, edged a high-quality first set. But Petrova hit back in a second-set tiebreak before Clijsters pulled clear in the decider, breaking three times. \"Everything\\'s fine with the wrist,\" said Clijsters. \"I could do everything I wanted to with my backhand - long backhand cross rallies, slicing. I really enjoyed every backhand.\\n\\n\"I had the intention of wearing Petrova down and I did. It was a relief to win a three-set match. \"These are the kind of matches I have been looking forward to for a long time.\" And the Belgian is looking forward to facing a severe test from Williams. \"A quarter-final against Venus is a nice prospect,\" said Clijsters. \"I saw her play and she is very strong right now, completely focused. \"It will be difficult on Friday, but fun as well.\" Third seed Williams, who will get a gold and diamond-encrusted racket should she add to her 2002 and 2003 event wins, was barely troubled against Razzano. \"My tennis was very good today,\" she said. \"But it is no surprise to me because I feel very healthy and have been working well lately.\"\\nFaultless Federer has no equal\\n\\nRoger Federer - nice bloke, fantastic tennis player - the ultimate sportsman.\\n\\nWhen Lleyton Hewitt shook his hand after getting another thrashing, a third in as many months, the Australian said; \"You\\'re the best.\" How right he is. The stats speak for themselves: 11 titles from 11 finals during 2004 - three of them Grand Slams - and 13 final victories in a row going back to Vienna 2003. That\\'s an open-era record. Hewitt, at times in Houston, showed form which easily matched his Grand Slam-winning efforts of 2001 and 2002. But he was outplayed. Twice. Hewitt, along with Andy Roddick and Marat Safin, is sure to be prominent during 2005. But realistically, all three will be fighting for the world number two ranking. According to all those players and even Federer himself, the Swiss star is in a different league.\\n\\n\"Right now I feel that a little bit,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I\\'ve dominated all the top ten players. They say nice things about me because I have beaten them all. I am dominating the game right now and I hope it continues!\" The number one player in the world is also the main man for promoting the sport off court. He has just been voted, by the International Tennis Writers, as the best \"Ambassador for Tennis\" on the ATP Tour. He has time for everyone. Every match, from first round to final, is followed by a series of press interviews in three languages; English, French and Swiss-German. After a major win, there are extra requests, obligations and interviews, all seen through to the end with courtesy and, most importantly, good humour. \"You guys are funny, I have a good time with you guys,\" he said, genuinely happy to talk into yet another tape recorder. \"I see you pretty much every day on the tour so to give away an hour for interviews is really no problem for me. \"If I can promote tennis and the sport then that is good for me. People say thanks back and that is nice.\" What a refreshing attitude from someone who could easily dominate the sports pages for a decade. It sums up his modest personality. Shortly after collecting a Waterford Crystal trophy, a Mercedes convertible and a tasty cheque for $1.5m, Federer addressed the Houston crowd and concluded by saying \"thanks for having me\". Now he just needs to find a way of winning the French Open, the one Grand Slam to so far elude him.\\nEdgy Agassi struggles past Dent\\n\\nAndre Agassi put in an erratic display before edging into the fourth round of the Australian Open with victory over Taylor Dent.\\n\\nThe 34-year-old American, seeded eighth, made a poor start, dropping serve early on and later needing two chances to serve out the set. Having secured the lead, Agassi still failed to take control as both players forced a succession of breaks. But Agassi won the tie-break before wrapping up a 7-5 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 win. Fourth seed\\n\\nsurvived an injury scare as he battled past Mario Ancic 6-4 3-6 6-3 6-4. The Russian turned his right ankle in the third game of the fourth set and called for treatment immediately. But he showed no sign of the problem when he returned to the court to wrap up victory in two hours 45 minutes.\\n\\nAncic, Wimbledon semi-finalist in 2004, looked set to push Safin all the way when he took the second set but Safin raised his game to sink the Croatian. Safin said he was trying to keep his temper under control at this year\\'s tournament. The Russian hit himself on the head repeatedly in one second-set outburst but was otherwise largely calm in his victory. \"I try to stay calm because if you go crazy against players like Ancic, you might never come back because he\\'s a tough opponent,\" he said. \"I\\'m a little bit calmer than I was before because I\\'d had enough.\" The Russian added that he was not worried by his ankle injury. \"I have had a lot of problems with that ankle before - it will be OK,\" he said.\\n\\n\\'s route to the fourth round was made easy when opponent Jarkko Nieminen was forced to retire from their match.\\n\\nThe top seed and defending champion was leading 6-3 5-2 when Nieminen pulled out with an abdominal injury. Federer had been in patchy form until then - mixing 19 unforced errors with 19 winners. The world number one will play Cypriot\\n\\nnext after the former world junior champion beat Tommy Robredo 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 6-1. Federer admitted he was under extra pressure after extending his winning streak to a career-best 24. \"They are so used to me winning, but it\\'s not that simple,\" he said. \"I had a feeling this could be a tough match. I had a bad start but I bounced back. I always want to play better than I am, but I thought I was pretty OK.\" French Open champion\\n\\nis out of the tournament after a five-set defeat by Dominik Hrbaty. Hrbaty defeated the 10th seed 7-6 (7-5) 6-7 (8-10) 6-7 (3-7) 6-1 6-3 in a match lasting four hours and 21 minutes. The pair traded 16 service breaks during an exhausting baseline battle, with Hrbaty taking a decisive advantage in the eighth game of the final set. Hrbaty will now play 2002 champion\\n\\n, who outlasted American Kevin Kim 3-6 6-2 6-7 6-2 6-2.\\nPhilippoussis doubt over Open bid\\n\\nMark Philippoussis is almost certain to miss the Australian Open after suffering a groin injury during the Hopman Cup loss to the Netherlands.\\n\\nThe 28-year-old suffered two tears to the adductor muscle and was unable to play in the deciding mixed doubles. He is now unlikely to be fit in time for the Australian Open which begins on 17 January in Melbourne. \"He has to strengthen it enough to cope with repetitive days of tennis,\" said Hopman Cup doctor Hamish Osborne. \"It would be very unlikely in my opinion for him to do a five-setter once, let alone two days in a row, inside two weeks.\\n\\n\"The injury is more common in Australian Rules football, and a fit footballer would normally take three to four weeks to recover fully although Mark\\'s injury is slightly different.\" The Australian has suffered a host of injury problems throughout his career but is still holding out slim hope that he can make the event. \"It\\'s something I\\'ll have to go by feel. I\\'ll start treatment as soon as possible and try to strengthen it without tearing it any more,\" he said. \"What doesn\\'t kill you makes you stronger. I know I can come back from this and that\\'s all that matters.\\n\\n- Former world number two Tommy Haas is also a doubt for the Australian Open after picking up a thigh injury playing for Germany in the Hopman Cup. The 26-year-old had treatment on his left thigh while leading Argentine Guillermo Coria 7-5 2-2. He played one more game, but his movement was hampered and he quit.\\nDent continues Adelaide progress\\n\\nAmerican Taylor Dent reached the final of the Australian hardcourt event in Adelaide with a crushing 6-1 6-1 win over Argentine Juan Ignacio Chela.\\n\\nDent will meet Swede Joachim Johansson on Sunday after the second seed survived a tense tie-break to defeat Belgium\\'s Olivier Rochus 6-1 7-6 (7/5). Johansson, the boyfriend of Lleyton Hewitt\\'s sister Jaslyn, received strong crowd support on Saturday. \"It feels like home for me, because Jaslyn lives here,\" said Johansson. Rochus was leading 5-4 in the second set tiebreak but his concentration was ruffled by a disputed line call and the match slipped away. \"It was so close - one mistake like this and the match is over, it\\'s tough. For me, it was clearly out,\" Rochus said.\\nAlmagro continues Spanish surge\\n\\nUnseeded Nicolas Almagro became the fifth Spaniard to reach the last eight at the Buenos Aires Open, ousting eighth seed Mariano Zabaleta.\\n\\nHe showed admirable resolve to win a rain-affected match 6-7 6-4 6-4. Compatriot and seventh seed Rafael Nadal also reached the last eight, beating Italian Potito Starace 6-1 6-3. Nadal, playing in the outdoor clay event for the first time, hit some powerful forehands to oust Starace in a match delayed over an hour by rain. \"It\\'s always a problem to have to stop for rain but one gets used to it,\" said Spanish teenager Nadal. \"Luckily, I was able to keep my pace going throughout the match.\" He will now play Gaston Gaudio, who beat unseeded Brazilian Flavio Saretta 6-3 6-2 in the day\\'s late match.\\nDavenport puts retirement on hold\\n\\nLindsay Davenport has put any talk of retirement on hold after having a largely injury-free 2004 campaign.\\n\\nThe 28-year-old world number one had said that she would quit at the end of last year, but after a successful season she has had a change of heart. \"Finally I felt I put myself in a position to try and win Grand Slams again,\" said Davenport. \"It would be tough to walk away when I feel like I can contend so there\\'s no point in hanging it up quite yet.\" Davenport has won three Grand Slams, the 2000 Australian Open, Wimbledon in 1999 and the 1998 US Open. Her career has been hit by a series of injuries but last year she started hitting top form and won seven titles. She was due to take part in this week\\'s Hopman Cup in Perth but decided she wanted to rest her knee. \"I just really wanted to make sure my right knee was going to be able to really withstand all the rigours of the whole year coming up,\" she said.\\nHewitt survives Nalbandian epic\\n\\nHome favourite Lleyton Hewitt came through a dramatic five-set battle with Argentine David Nalbandian to reach the Australian Open semi-finals.\\n\\nHewitt looked to be cruising to victory after racing into a two-set lead. But Nalbandian broke his serve three times in both of the next two sets to set up a nailbiting decider. Hewitt eventually grabbed the vital break in the 17th game and served out to win 6-3 6-2 1-6 3-6 10-8 and set up a meeting with Andy Roddick. The winner of that match will face either Roger Federer or Marat Safin in the final. Ninth seed Nalbandian had never come back from two sets down to win a match, and there was no indication he would do so as Hewitt dominated the first two sets.\\n\\nThe Argentine had stoked up the temperature ahead of the match by saying Hewitt\\'s exuberant on-court celebrations were \"not very good for the sport\". And he had words with Hewitt during one change of ends in the second set when the Australian appeared to brush shoulders with him as they went to their chairs. The balance of power changed completely in the third set as Hewitt allowed his level to dip, and he double-faulted twice as Nalbandian broke on the way to taking the fourth set. But the tiring third seed showed incredible reserves of strength to force the break despite being outplayed for much of the final set and three times coming within two points of defeat. He then produced a love service game to finish off the match in four hours and five minutes. \"I just kept hanging in there. It was always tough serving second in the fifth set,\" said Hewitt, who had never reached the last four at his home Grand Slam. \"I told myself to give everything and in the end it paid off once again. \"It\\'s a long way from holding that trophy up there but I\\'m hanging in there. \"Only four guys left that can win and we\\'re the top four in the world. It\\'s set up for a pretty good showdown in the semis and finals.\"\\nMauresmo opens with victory in LA\\n\\nAmelie Mauresmo and Maria Sharapova won their opening matches at the Tour Championships in Los Angeles.\\n\\nFrance\\'s Mauresmo routed Vera Zvonareva 6-1 6-0, while Wimbledon champion Sharapova was a 6-1 6-4 winner over fellow Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova. American Serena Williams also won, edging Russian Elena Dementieva 7-6 7-5 for her second victory of the event. The event is split into two groups of four with the top two from each advancing to the semi-finals.\\n\\nMauresmo\\'s win was her ninth in a row as she tries to overtake Lindsay Davenport for the number one spot. Mauresmo spent five weeks at number one after the US Open before injury ushered Davenport back in front. \"Since then, I feel very confident on court and my game is there. I want to get the ranking back, but it\\'s very different than before I was number one. \"It was an obsession, but now I take it in a relaxed way.\" Mauresmo completed her first match in the season-ending championship in 54 minutes as Russia\\'s Zvonareva struggled to return her serve and failed to achieve a single break point.\\n\\n\"She got mad a little bit and I played some great tennis,\" said Mauresmo, who was runner-up to Kim Clijsters in last year\\'s final. Zvonareva has lost both her games so far, having crashed 6-2 6-4 Kuznetsova in the Staples Centre on Wednesday. \"Sometimes not everything works,\" she said. \"It was lots of pressure. Maybe that is why I couldn\\'t do 100%. But I was fighting.\" Sharapova, who lost 6-2 6-2 to Kuznetsova in Beijing in September, said: \"In Beijing, she was coming off such a big winning streak [14 matches] and she was unstoppable. \"This time, it was important to start off well and put some pressure on her.\" The tournament debutant added: \"I love it here. The atmosphere is great. \"To be here where the Lakers play, you just feel that excitement. I love basketball.\" Williams admitted she is still some way off her best form but remained positive after two wins in two days. \"It\\'s hard to go out there and get it right but I\\'m fighting and I\\'m hoping,\" said Williams. \"What makes me happy is the effort. I had a really good effort today. \"I\\'m trying to add new dimensions to my game.\"\\nSydney return for Henin-Hardenne\\n\\nOlympic champion Justine Henin-Hardenne will return to action in January\\'s Sydney International tournament.\\n\\nThe Belgian has not competed since losing her top world ranking at the US Open in September, where she was beaten in the fourth round by Nadia Petrova. She took time out to shake off a virus but will defend her titles in Sydney and at the Australian Open. Women\\'s world number one Lindsay Davenport and French Open champion Anastasia Myskina will also compete.\\n\\nIn the men\\'s event, world number three Lleyton Hewitt returns to defend his title, along with runner-up Carlos Moya. Moya, Spain\\'s Davis Cup final hero in their recent win over the US, had to retire with an ankle injury in the first set of the final.\\n\\nTournament director Craig Watson said: \"I had a message relayed to me from him after Spain\\'s Davis Cup victory, saying he was looking forward to trying to make up for his disappointment in the (2004) final. The tournament will take place from 9-15 January.\\nMirza shocks Kuznetsova\\n\\nSania Mirza continued her remarkable rise with victory over US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova at the Dubai Championships on Tuesday.\\n\\nThe 18-year-old Indian, who is already a huge star in her home country, won 6-4 6-2 in front of a delirious crowd. It was Mirza\\'s sixth straight victory following her first WTA tournament win in Hyderabad last month. Earlier, Daniela Hantuchova built on her improving form with a 7-6 6-2 win over sixth seed Alicia Molik. Mirza needed attention to an ankle injury after the second game against Kuznetsova.\\n\\nShe quickly slipped 4-0 down but staged a dramatic comeback that thrilled the large Indian contingent in the crowd. \"I really didn\\'t expect that after my ankle turn,\" said Mirza. \"I played a great match and I think (the crowd) did it again. I knew that I had to play an all-round game and that\\'s what happened. \"I did everything well but I wasn\\'t missing the ball - I don\\'t know how that happened.\" Mirza plays Silvia Farina Elia or Jelena Jankovic next. Hantuchova has risen from 31 in the world at the turn of the year to number 22, having reached the quarter-finals and semi-finals at her last two events. \"It was such a tough first-round match and I am glad to come through,\" said Hantuchova. \"She was serving so well. I just decided to hang in there and keep fighting.\" The Slovakian will meet Elena Likhovtseva in the second round after the Russian struggled past Tunisian wild card Selima Sfar 2-6 6-2 7-6. Likhovtseva needed nine match points before seeing off Sfar, who got a point penalty for swearing in the third set. Seventh seed Nathalie Dechy and Elena Bovina were among other first-round winners on Tuesday.\\nHewitt fights back to reach final\\n\\nLleyton Hewitt kept his dream of an Australian Open title alive with a four-set win over Andy Roddick in Friday\\'s second semi-final.\\n\\nThe home favourite will face Marat Safin in Sunday\\'s final after coming through 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4) 6-1. Hewitt fought back from a set down and trailed in both tie-breaks but would not be denied, thrilling the Melbourne crowd with a typically battling effort. He is aiming to be the first Australian winner since Mark Edmondson in 1976. Hewitt is the first Australian to make the final since Pat Cash lost to Mats Wilander in 1988, but faces a huge challenge against Safin - the conqueror of Roger Federer. After needing five sets in his last two matches there was reason to think Hewitt might struggle for fitness. He certainly made a sluggish start, dropping his opening service game, and Roddick dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set.\\n\\nAfter 12 tense games in the second, the key moment came when Hewitt raised his game in the tie-break to overturn an early mini-break. That energised the crowd but Roddick was not finished and raced 4-1 clear in the crucial third before Hewitt pegged him back and forced another tie-break. Again Roddick broke first and again Hewitt fought back, taking the lead with a superb backhand pass.\\n\\nThe Australian was not to be denied and a disheartened Roddick made little impact in the fourth set as Hewitt raced to victory, sending the Melbourne crowd wild and ensuring the final will be a huge occasion. \"It\\'s awesome,\" said Hewitt. \"I started preparing for this tournament nine months ago. \"I\\'ve done a lot of hard yards to get here. \"I\\'ve always said I\\'d do anything to get in the first night final at the Australian Open. Now I\\'ve got my chance.\" Roddick was furious with himself for failing to take advantage of leads in both tie-breaks. \"I\\'m usually pretty money in those,\" said Roddick. \"Either one of those would have given me a distinct advantage. \"I\\'m mad, I felt I was in there with a shot. He put himself in position to win big points. I donated a little more than I would have wanted.\" And the American played down the influence of one spectator who appeared to contribute to a double fault by shouting during Rodick\\'s service action. \"It just took one jackass to shout out,\" said Roddick, adding that the crowd overall was \"very respectful\".\\nMelzer shocks Agassi in San Jose\\n\\nSecond seed Andre Agassi suffered a comprehensive defeat by Jurgen Melzer in the quarter-finals of the SAP Open.\\n\\nAgassi was often bamboozled by the Austrian\\'s drop shots in San Jose, losing 6-3 6-1. Defending champion and top seed Andy Roddick rallied to beat Sweden\\'s Thomas Enqvist 3-6 7-6 (8-6) 7-5. But unseeded Cyril Saulnier beat the fourth seed Vincent Spadea 6-2 6-4 and Tommy Haas overcame eighth seed Max Mirnyi 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (7-3) 6-2. Melzer has now beaten Agassi in two of their three meetings.\\n\\n\"I had a good game plan and I executed it perfectly,\" he said. \"It\\'s always tough to come out to play Andre. \"I didn\\'t want him to play his game. He makes you run like a dog all over the court.\" And Agassi, who was more than matched for power by his opponent\\'s two-handed backhand, said Melzer was an example of several players on the tour willing to take their chances against him. \"A lot more guys are capable of it now,\" said the American. \"He played much better than me. That\\'s what he did both times. \"I had opportunities to loosen myself up,\" Agassi added. \"But I didn\\'t convert on the big points.\"\\nIvanovic seals Canberra victory\\n\\nSerbia\\'s Ana Ivanovic captured her first WTA title with a straight-sets victory over Hungarian Melinda Czink in the final of the Canberra Classic.\\n\\nThe 17-year-old took 83 minutes to take the match 7-5 6-1. Ivanovic beat Czink in the last round of qualifying but the Hungarian made the main draw as a lucky loser after Katarina Srebotnik withdrew injured. Ivanovic said: \"I was really nervous in the beginning, but I pulled through and didn\\'t do too much wrong.\" A junior Wimbledon finalist last year, she added: \"It\\'s my first WTA title, and to win it has really given me more energy to practice and improve.\" Ivanovic will play 32nd seed Iveta Benesova of the Czech Republic in the first round.said of the Australian Open in Melbourne.\\nSlovakia reach Hopman Cup final\\n\\nSlovakia will play Argentina in the final of the Hopman Cup after beating Group B rivals the Netherlands 3-0.\\n\\nDaniela Hantuchova defeated Michaella Krajicek 6-4 6-2 to give the Slovaks the perfect start before Dutchman Peter Wessels retired against Dominik Hrbaty. Wessels was unable to compete in the mixed doubles but Slovakia had already booked their place in the final for the second year running. Argentina claimed top spot in Group A with three wins from three matches. In the other Group B match, the United States defeated Australia 2-1.\\n\\nMeghann Shaughnessy lost the opening match against Alicia Molik but James Blake levelled the tie with a 6-3 6-4 win over Paul Baccanello, who came in as a replacement for the injured Mark Philippoussis. Blake and Shaughnessy then beat Molik and Baccanello in a tense mixed doubles contest to take the win. Hantuchova, who did not win a Hopman Cup singles match in 2004, has been in good form during this year\\'s event and has won two of her three matches. \"I feel like it\\'s really deserved this time as I\\'ve helped Dominik to get through,\" she said. \"I think if I keep going the way I have been in the past few matches then I will be okay. \"I was really pleased with my last two singles, even the first one, which was a really high standard. \"You can\\'t ask for a better preparation than to play a few matches here for the Australian Open.\"\\nClijsters set for February return\\n\\nTennis star Kim Clijsters will make her return from a career-threatening injury at the Antwerp WTA event in February.\\n\\n\"Kim had considered returning to action in Paris on 7 February,\" a statement on her website said. \"She\\'s decided against this so that she does not risk the final phase of her recovery. If all goes well, Kim will make her return on February 15.\" The 21-year-old has not played since last October after aggravating a wrist injury at the Belgian Open. Back then, a doctor treating the Belgian feared that her career may be over, with the player having already endured an operation earlier in the season to cure her wrist problem. \"I hope she comes back, but I\\'m pessimistic,\" said Bruno Willems. Clijsters was also due to marry fellow tennis star Lleyton Hewitt in February but the pair split \"for private reasons\" back in October.\\nNavratilova hits out at critics\\n\\nMartina Navratilova has defended her decision to prolong her tennis career at the age of 48.\\n\\nNavratilova, who made a comeback after retiring in 1994, will play doubles and mixed doubles events in 2005. \"Women\\'s tennis is really strong,\" she said, dismissing suggestions that the fact she could still win reflected badly on the women\\'s game. \"All I can say is I\\'m that damn good. I\\'m sorry but I really have to blow my own horn here. I\\'m still that good.\" Navratilova has won three Grand Slam mixed doubles titles since she came out of retirement. And she was so encouraged by her form that she decided to resume playing singles, winning two of her seven matches. She was knocked out in the first round of the French Open but reached the second round at Wimbledon. Navratilova will partner Nathalie Dechy in the doubles event at the Uncle Toby\\'s Hardcourts tournament on Australia\\'s Gold Coast, which begins on Sunday. She will then link up with Daniela Hantuchova for the Australian Open doubles, and play in the mixed doubles with Leander Paes. \"I might be playing some singles events this season, depending on the surface,\" she added.\\nInjured Roddick quits in Memphis\\n\\nAndy Roddick has pulled out of his semi-final at the RMK Championships in Memphis after spraining his left ankle.\\n\\nThe American top seed was was supposed to face Dane Kenneth Carlsen, who now advances to the final against eighth seed Max Mirnyi of Belarus. He came through his semi-final against German second seed Tommy Haas 7-5 6-3. Roddick, the 2003 US Open champion, was hurt during his quarter-final win on Friday and had intensive treatment on his ankle to no avail. He attempted to loosen up his foot by jogging on Saturday, then tried to hit a couple of balls. \"The first really kind of significant move I made I just knew that it wasn\\'t going to happen for me,\" Roddick said. He decided to pass on a chance to win his second tour title in two weeks in part because he wants to be healthy for the US team\\'s Davis Cup match against Croatia in a fortnight. \"The repercussions of this injury wouldn\\'t just affect me. It would affect my team-mates and playing for my country as well,\" Roddick said.\\nRochus shocks Coria in Auckland\\n\\nTop seed Guillermo Coria went out of the Heineken Open in Auckland on Thursday with a surprise loss to Olivier Rochus of Belgium.\\n\\nCoria lost the semi-final 6-4 6-4 to Rochus, who goes on to face Czech Jan Hernych, a 6-4 7-5 winner over Jose Acasuso of Argentina. Fifth seed Fernando Gonzalez eased past American Robby Ginepri 6-3 6-4. The Chilean will meet sixth seed Juan Ignacio Chela next after the Argentine beat Potito Starace 6-1 7-6 (7-5). Rochus made the semi-finals at the Australian hardcourt championships in Adelaide last week and is naturally delighted with his form. \"It\\'s been two unbelievable weeks for me,\" he said. \"Today I knew I had nothing to lose. If I beat him great, if I lost, I would be losing to a top-10 player.\" Coria conceded that Rochus \"played just too good,\" and added: \"When you give your best out there you can\\'t be too sad.\"\\nHenman hopes ended in Dubai rain\\n\\nThird seed Tim Henman slumped to a straight sets defeat in his rain-interrupted Dubai Championships quarter-final against Ivan Ljubicic.\\n\\nThe Croatian eighth seed booked his place in the last four with a 7-5 6-4 victory over the British number one. Henman had looked on course to level the match after going 2-0 up in the second set, but his progress was halted as the rain intervened again. Ljubicic hit back after the break to seal a fourth straight win over Henman. Earlier in the day, Spanish fifth seed Tommy Robredo secured his semi-final place when he beat Nicolas Kiefer of Germany 6-4 6-4.\\n\\nThe rain means the other quarter-finals between Roger Federer and Mikhail Youzhny and Andre Agassi and Nikolay Davydenko will now be played on Saturday. Henman was left cursing the weather and the umpire after seven breaks for rain during his match. \"It was incredibly frustrating,\" Henman said. \"It\\'s raining and the umpire doesn\\'t take control. \"He kept telling us to play till the end of the game. But if it\\'s raining, you come off - the score\\'s irrelevant. \"It couldn\\'t be more frustrating as I was very happy with my form until now. You don\\'t expect this in the desert.\" The rain meant the two remaining quarter-finals - Roger Federer against Mikhail Youzhny and Andre Agassi versus Nikolay Davydenko - were postponed until Saturday.\\nConnors\\' rallying cry for British tennis\\n\\n\"Do you have it in your heart? How much guts do you have? How much do you hate to lose?\"\\n\\nThese are the questions Jimmy Connors will be asking of Britain\\'s brightest tennis hopes in the months, and possibly years, to come. The American legend swept into London on Thursday to announce a \"long-term\" relationship with the Lawn Tennis Association after spending three days at the Elite Performance winter camp in La Manga. And the man who epitomised the phrase \\'will to win\\' before Lleyton Hewitt was even born is clear about the qualities he hopes to convey. \"You know, everybody hits the ball well and there\\'s a very fine line between number one and number 100,\" said Connors. \"I was that fine line for a long time. But if I can help, I want to be part of teaching kids how to win.\"\\n\\nConnors is not the first great name to offer his services to the LTA - his long-time rival John McEnroe has repeatedly done the same. But Connors is at pains to point out that his interest goes well beyond any publicity stunt, and he gave a glowing recommendation to the work of LTA performance director David Felgate and his team. \"Britain has a different attitude, the right attitude, in taking the game forward and finding the next Wimbledon champion,\" said Connors. \"That\\'s something you don\\'t find every day. Everybody talks a good game but not everybody puts that into effect. \"The impression I came away with after just seeing David and the other coaches for three days was one like I\\'ve never seen before, especially over here. \"This is not going to happen overnight, there are no miracle workers, but you\\'re going in the right direction.\" The 52-year-old\\'s enthusiasm for the work going on in this country is in marked contrast to his relationship with tennis officials back in America. \"I\\'ve had discussions with the USTA (United States Tennis Association) over a number of years,\" he said. \"That\\'s where it (my input) ended.\" Connors is a straight-talker and will be equally blunt and honest in his dealings with the LTA and the cream of Britain\\'s young players. \"If they\\'re chosen, they\\'ve got to produce,\" he said.\\n\\n\"If not, someone will come and take their place. There\\'s only one number one spot and it\\'s lonely up there, but it\\'s got the best view.\" In the year that has seen Andrew Murray emerge as Britain\\'s great new hope, Connors rejected suggestions that the Scot might be put under too much pressure too soon. \"Tim Henman has a whole country on his shoulder,\" said Connors. \"I don\\'t know that pressure, but if you like that it can be a certain push to get on to the next level. \"Someone\\'s going to have to come and take over from him (Henman). If I was Andrew Murray, I\\'d embrace that. That\\'s what we play for.\" Despite the emphasis on hard work, training and preparation, Connors does admit that the desire required of a champion has to come from within. \"The passion I had, I don\\'t know if you can find that,\" he admitted. \"I was also nuts. I say that because there was nothing better for me than to compete on the tennis court. \"It was the most important thing in the world for me, and to do that something\\'s got to be not right with you. There was nothing better for me ever than to play tennis in front of 25,000 people. \"What I had when I played tennis is what I am. You have to have that, you can\\'t be moulded.\"\\nHewitt falls to Dent in Adelaide\\n\\nLleyton Hewitt suffered a shock defeat to Taylor Dent in the quarter-finals of the Australian Hardcourt Championships in Adelaide on Friday.\\n\\nThe top seed was a strong favourite for the title but went down 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 to the American. Dent will face Juan Ignacio Chela next after the fourth seed was too strong for Jurgen Melzer. Olivier Rochus beat third seed Nicolas Kiefer 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (8-6) 7-5 and will take on second seed Joachim Johansson. The Swede reached the last four by beating compatriot Thomas Enqvist 6-3 4-6 6-1. \"I felt like I was striking the ball much better,\" said Johansson.\\n\\n\"I felt like I had a lot of break chances, I didn\\'t take care of them all, but I broke him four times and he only broke me once. \"I felt that was the key to get up in the set early.\" Hewitt played down his defeat and insisted he is focused solely on the Australian Open, which starts on 17 January. \"When you\\'ve been number one in the world for a couple of years and won a couple of slams, you look at the big picture and what motivates you,\" said Hewitt. \"That\\'s the Grand Slams and Melbourne\\'s as big for me as any of the four. Even if I don\\'t win Sydney next week it\\'s no big deal.\"\\nHenman overcomes rival Rusedski\\n\\nTim Henman saved a match point before fighting back to defeat British rival Greg Rusedski 4-6 7-6 (8-6) 6-4 at the Dubai Tennis Championships on Tuesday.\\n\\nWorld number 46 Rusedski broke in the ninth game to take a tight opening set. Rusedski had match point at 6-5 in the second set tie-break after Henman double-faulted, but missed his chance and Henman rallied to clinch the set. The British number one then showed his superior strength to take the decider and earn his sixth win over Rusedski. Serve was held by both players with few alarms until the seventh game of the final set, when Rusedski\\'s wild volley gave Henman a vital break. A furious Rusedski slammed his racket onto the ground in disgust and was warned by the umpire.\\n\\nHenman, seeded three, then held his serve comfortably thanks to four serve-and-volley winners to take a clear 5-3 lead. Rusedski won his service game but Henman took the first of his three match points with a service winner to secure his place in the second round at Dubai for the first time in three years. It was the first match between the pair for three years - Henman last lost to Rusedski six years ago - and lasted two hours and 40 minutes. The pair are now likely to only face each other on court as rivals - rather than as team-mates - after Henman decided to retire from Davis Cup tennis leaving Rusedski to lead the team out against Israel on 4-6 March. Henman, who now faces Russian Igor Andreev in the last 16, admitted afterwards it was difficult coming up against his compatriot on a fast surface. \"You just take it point by point when you\\'re fighting to stay in the match,\" he said. \"I had to keep playing aggressively and competing to get a chance. \"I now have to recover in time for the next match because the body doesn\\'t recover as quick as it used to, especially after two hours and 40 minutes.\"\\nMauresmo fights back to win title\\n\\nWorld number two Amelie Mauresmo came from a set down to beat Venus Williams and win the Diamond Games in Antwerp.\\n\\nMauresmo, who lost to Dinara Safina in the final of the Paris Indoor Open last week, beat the third seed 4-6 7-5 6-4 for her first title of the season. The Frenchwoman produced some superb volleys in the final set and claimed victory on her fifth match point after two hours and 18 minutes. \"This was a great final for a great tournament,\" she said. \"I am so happy because the quality of my game went up and up during the whole week until the final, this is the result of all the work I have done with my coach.\" Williams was seeking her third title in Antwerp having won it on her two previous visits in 2002 and 2003. The defeat means she has now gone 11 tournaments without a title, the longest drought of her career. \"Amelie deserves her win, she played so well,\" she said.\\nMelzer shocks Agassi\\n\\nSecond seed Andre Agassi suffered a comprehensive defeat by Jurgen Melzer in the quarter-finals of the SAP Open.\\n\\nAgassi was often bamboozled by the Austrian\\'s drop shots in San Jose, losing 6-3 6-1. Defending champion and top seed Andy Roddick rallied to beat Sweden\\'s Thomas Enqvist 3-6 7-6 (8-6) 7-5. But unseeded Cyril Saulnier beat the fourth seed Vincent Spadea 6-2 6-4 and Tommy Haas overcame eighth seed Max Mirnyi 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (7-3) 6-2. Melzer has now beaten Agassi in two of their three meetings.\\n\\n\"I had a good game plan and I executed it perfectly,\" he said. \"It\\'s always tough to come out to play Andre. \"I didn\\'t want him to play his game. He makes you run like a dog all over the court.\" And Agassi, who was more than matched for power by his opponent\\'s two-handed backhand, said Melzer was an example of several players on the tour willing to take their chances against him. \"A lot more guys are capable of it now,\" said the American. \"He played much better than me. That\\'s what he did both times. \"I had opportunities to loosen myself up,\" Agassi added. \"But I didn\\'t convert on the big points.\"\\nNadal marches on in Mexico\\n\\nRafael Nadal continued his run of fine form to beat Guillermo Canas and reach the Mexican Open semis in Acapulco.\\n\\nEighth seed Nadal, who picked up his second ATP title when he beat Alberto Martin in last week\\'s Brazil Open, saw off the Argentine third seed 7-5 6-3. He now meets Argentine wild card Mariano Puerta, who followed up his win over top seed Carlos Moya by overcoming Spain\\'s Felix Mantilla, 6-4 3-6 7-6. Czech fifth seed Czech Jiri Novak was eliminated 7-5 6-1 by Agustin Calleri. The unseeded Argentine, who won the tournament two years ago, now plays Spain\\'s Albert Montanes. Montanes advanced to his first semi-final of the year with a 4-6 6-3 6-4 triumph over sixth-seeded Italian Filippo Volandri. Argentina\\'s Agustin Calleri beat fourth seed Jiri Novak 7-5 6-1 in a battle of former champions at the Mexican Open. Calleri won his only ATP title in Acapulco two years ago while Novak won the singles and doubles titles in 1998. Calleri will face Albert Montanes in the semi-finals after the Spaniard ousted sixth seed Filippo Volandri of Italy 4-6 6-3 6-4. Argentine wild card Mariano Puerta continued his improbable run, outlasting Felix Mantilla 6-4 3-6 7-6.\\nClassy Henman makes winning start\\n\\nTim Henman opened his 2005 campaign with a 6-1 7-5 victory over Argentine David Nalbandian at the Kooyong Classic exhibition tournament on Wednesday.\\n\\nThe British number one will next play Roger Federer at the Australian Open warm-up event on Friday. The world number one beat Gaston Gaudio 5-7 6-1 6-4, before Andre Agassi saw off Chilean Olympic gold medalist Nicolas Massu 6-1 7-6 (7-4). Andy Roddick beat Ivan Ljubicic, who replaced Paradorn Srichaphan, 6-1 6-4. Henman made an impressive start to the year, only faltering against Nalbandian when serving for the match at 5-4. But the Briton regained his composure to win the next two games for only his second win in six matches against the Argentine. \"It\\'s a great start to the year - just what I was looking for,\" Henman told his website. \"Over the years I\\'ve found David very difficult to play against.\\n\\n\"He returns serve very well and he\\'s deceptively effective from the baseline, so sometimes it can be difficult to execute my gameplan well enough against him to get the right result. \"Beating somebody of his stature is always good for the confidence and it bodes well at the beginning of the year.\" Henman also revealed the extent of the back problems he suffered in the off-season. \"I\\'m not the most flexible and at the end of the year I was pretty exhausted and wanted to have a couple of weeks where I didn\\'t do anything,\" said Henman. \"When I started training again it really, really seized up. As much as I enjoyed the two weeks off I don\\'t think it\\'s so productive.\" Federer dropped a tight first set against 2004 French Open champion Gaudio, but was content with his game. \"It was about getting used to the surface,\" he said.\\n\\n\"The conditions are much quicker than Doha, my timing was OK, but I could have served better. \"All in all I\\'m happy with the match, and I won it - that\\'s a good sign. Now I have a day off and hopefully play better the next match.\" Agassi was delighted with victory over Massu in his first match for over two months. \"I felt pretty good,\" said the American. \"I liked the way the match played out and, maybe excluding a few second serve returns, I felt like I was doing most things pretty darn well for the first match.\"\\nFerrero eyes return to top form\\n\\nFormer world number one Juan Carlos Ferrero insists he can get back to his best despite a tough start to 2005.\\n\\nThe 2003 French Open champion has slipped to 64 in the world after a year of illness and injuries in 2004, but is confident that his form will return. \"I don\\'t know when it is going to happen,\" Ferrero told BBC Sport. \"But I have a lot of confidence in me that I will be the same Juan Carlos as I was before, and very soon. I feel 100% again mentally.\" The 25-year-old Spaniard joins a top field for the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam this week as he looks to add to just two wins in 2005. He opens against Rainer Schuettler and potentially faces fourth seed David Nalbandian in the second round. \"Because I\\'m no longer seeded it\\'s tougher,\" Ferrero admitted. \"I had to play against Joachim Johansson in the first round last week in Marseille.\\n\\n\"In the past when I was a top seed I would have played a match like that in the quarters or semi-finals. \"This is the big difference but I have to do it to get higher in the rankings.\" Despite this, Ferrero insists he is feeling positive after chicken pox and a rib injury destroyed last season. \"Physically I am 100% since December of last year,\" said Ferrero. \"I was working very hard before the Davis Cup final to prepare and I\\'ve felt 100% from then until now. \"The difficult moments were when I knew that I had the chicken pox and that it would take two or three months to recover. \"I had to start from zero again physically because the virus left me at zero per cent. \"When I started to come back I had my rib broken when I fell on court and that was another two months out. Those five months were pretty difficult for me.\"\\n\\nAmong the low points of a difficult year for Ferrero was the decision of Spain captain Jordi Arrese to drop him for the Davis Cup final against the USA. \"It was difficult because I had been playing well for the whole year and the coaches told me that I would play,\" said Ferrero. \"But then I had some problems with my hand two days before the Friday matches so they decided to choose Nadal instead. \"It was difficult for me not to be in the Friday matches but I had to understand. \"Inside me I wanted to play but this was the decision of the captain and they had to make it.\"\\nDogged Federer claims Dubai crown\\n\\nWorld number one Roger Federer added the Dubai Championship trophy to his long list of successes - but not before he was given a test by Ivan Ljubicic.\\n\\nTop seed Federer looked to be on course for a easy victory when he thumped the eighth seed 6-1 in the first set. But Ljubicic, who beat Tim Henman in the last eight, dug deep to secure the second set after a tense tiebreak. Swiss star Federer was not about to lose his cool, though, turning on the style to win the deciding set 6-3. The match was a re-run of last week\\'s final at the World Indoor Tournament in Rotterdam, where Federer triumphed, but not until Ljubicic had stretched him all the way. \"I really wanted to get off to a good start this time, and I did, and I could really play with confidence while he still looking for his rhythm,\" Federer said.\\n\\n\"That took me all the way through to 6-1 3-1 0-30 on his serve and I almost ran away with it. But he came back, and that was a good effort on his side.\" Ljubicic was at a loss to explain his poor showing in the first set. \"I didn\\'t start badly, but then suddenly I felt like my racket was loose and the balls were flying a little bit too much. And with Roger, if you relax for a second it just goes very quick,\" he said. \"After those first three games it was no match at all. I don\\'t know, it was really weird. I was playing really well the whole year, and then suddenly I found myself in trouble just to put the ball in the court.\" But despite his defeat, the world number 14 was pleased with his overall performance. \"I had a chance in the third, and for me it\\'s really positive to twice in two weeks have a chance against Roger to win the match. \"It\\'s an absolutely great boost to my confidence that I\\'m up there and belong with top-class players.\"\\nClijsters hope on Aussie Open\\n\\nKim Clijsters has denied reports that she has pulled out of January\\'s Australian Open because of her persistent wrist injury.\\n\\nOpen chief Paul McNamee had said: \"Kim\\'s wrist obviously isn\\'t going to be rehabilitated.\" But her spokesman insisted she had simply delayed submitting her entry. \"The doctors are assessing her injury on a weekly basis and if there is no risk she could play. But if there\\'s the least risk she will stay away.\" Despite being absent from the WTA entry list for the tournament, which begins on 17 January, Clijsters would be certain to get a wild card if she requested one. Clijsters is still ranked 22nd in the world despite only playing a handful of matches last season. The Belgian had an operation on her left wrist early in the season but injured it again on her return to the tour. Meanwhile, Jelena Dokic, who used to compete for Australia, has opted out of the first Grand Slam of the season. Dokic has not played in the Australian Open since 2001 when she lost in the first round. But the 21-year-old would have had to rely on a wild card next season because her ranking has tumbled to 127th. Four-time champion Monica Seles, who has not played since last year\\'s French Open, is another absentee because of an injured left foot.\\nMoya fights back for Indian title\\n\\nCarlos Moya became the first man to successfully defend the Chennai Open title by beating four-times finalist Paradorn Srichaphan 3-6 6-4 7-6 (7/5).\\n\\nThe Spaniard then donated his £28,000 prize money to relief efforts for the victims of the Asian tsunami. The final was close throughout, with Thai second seed Srichaphan - the 2003 winner - closing out the first set. But Moya took the second set, before bouncing back from 5-2 down in the decider to force and win a tie-break. Moya confirmed afterwards: \"I\\'m donating my prize money from this tournament for the tsunami victims, hoping it makes some difference to their lives. His contribution follows pledges by four other players to donate their prize money from the tournament, which went ahead after the 26 December disaster which has so far claimed at least 150,000 lives. Scrichapan said he would donate an unspecified amount for relief work in Thailand, where more than 5,000 people were killed. The ATP has announced that it would contribute the US$25,000 tournament fee to Unicef\\'s emergency relief fund in Tamil Nadu. The ATP Tour\\'s sponsor, Mercedes, said it would also contribute, increasing the ATP donation to US$40,000.\\nDavenport hits out at Wimbledon\\n\\nWorld number one Lindsay Davenport has criticised Wimbledon over the issue of equal prize money for women.\\n\\nReacting to a disputed comment by All England Club chairman Tim Phillips, the American said: \"I think it is highly insulting if prize money is taken away. \"Somebody, I think it was Mr Phillips, said they won\\'t have money for flowers at Wimbledon. That\\'s insulting.\" An All England club spokesperson denied Phillips made the remark, insisting: \"He definitely didn\\'t say it.\" The statement added: \"It was said by someone else and was a humorous aside at the end of a radio interview when the conversation had moved to talking about the Wimbledon grounds.\"\\n\\nDavenport was speaking following the announcement that this week\\'s Dubai Duty Free event will join the US and Australian Opens in offering equal prize money for women. \"You hear about women playing only three sets while men play five,\" said Daveport. \"And the best women are never going to beat the best men. \"But it\\'s a different game you go to watch with the women - it doesn\\'t make it better or worse. \"Hopefully we will be able to change people\\'s minds.\"\\n\\nSerena Williams, who is also in Dubai, added: \"I\\'m obviously for equal prize money. \"Women\\'s tennis is exciting. Men\\'s tennis is exciting as well, but the women have it right now. \"If you are bringing in the spectators you should be able to reap what everyone else is able to reap.\"\\nFederer joins all-time greats\\n\\nThe last year has seen one player dominate men\\'s tennis, and one country dominate the women\\'s game.\\n\\nRoger Federer became the first man since Mats Wilander in 1988 to win three Grand Slams in one season. And after Anastasia Myskina became the first Russian woman to win a Grand Slam at the French Open, two more followed at Wimbledon and the US Open. Meanwhile, Briton Tim Henman enjoyed his best year, while Greg Rusedski fought back superbly from adversity. Federer began the year as world number one and holder of the Wimbledon and Masters Cup titles, and set about conquering new ground. The Swiss sounded warning of the dominance to come at the Australian Open.\\n\\nHe ripped through the draw before beating Marat Safin in the final. Andy Roddick was the only player to put up any real resistance at Wimbledon, and Federer\\'s performance against Lleyton Hewitt in the US Open final was breathtaking. Federer again got the better of Hewitt in the season-ending Masters Cup. His victory in Houston proved to be his 13th successive win in a final, an Open era record. The only major let-down was a third-round loss to Gustavo Kuerten at the French Open, and Roland Garros will be his main target in 2005.\\n\\nThere was also a surprise loss to the unheralded Tomas Berdych at the Olympic Games, which saw Chile dominate as Nicoals Massu took the singles and then paired up with Fernando Gonzaelz to win doubles gold. Another major trophy that looks beyond Federer is the Davis Cup, which was won by Spain in a 3-2 home success over the USA in Seville. Roddick struggled on the clay, losing to Rafael Nadal on the opening day before going down to Carlos Moya in the all-important fourth rubber.\\n\\nHenman broke new ground by reaching the semis on clay at the French Open - a stunning effort - and also at the US Open. A quarter-final defeat to Mario Ancic at Wimbledon was disappointing for the limp manner of the Briton\\'s defeat, but he remains optimistic of going further next year.\\n\\nBritish number two Rusedski endured a rollercoaster year, returning to the circuit after being cleared of a doping offence in March. With his ranking down at 168, many feared the 31-year-old\\'s career was over, but he battled back in the second half of the season to re-enter the top 50. The Russian women finally delivered on their long-recognised promise in 2004, with Myskina, Maria Sharapova and Svetlana Kuznetsova winning Grand Slams, before taking the season-ending Fed Cup. But while the young Russians were on the way up, it was a different story for the Belgians and the Williams sisters. Only veteran Lindsay Davenport held the new wave at bay, a stunning run of form after Wimbledon taking her to number one ahead of Amelie Mauresmo, whose Grand Slam drought goes on. The year started in regulation fashion as Justine Henin-Hardenne beat compatriot Kim Clijsters at the Australian Open.\\n\\nA virus ruined the rest of Henin-Hardenne\\'s year, although she was fit enough to win Olympic gold, but Clijsters had an even more miserable 2004. She suffered a serious wrist injury and then announced the end of her relationship with Lleyton Hewitt, and will be happy to see the year end. In their absence, Myskina thrashed Elena Dementieva in a historic, but woeful, all-Russian final at the French Open. Wimbledon was a more refreshing affair as Sharapova captivated SW19, showing nerves of steel as she battled past Davenport and Serena Williams to take the title.\\n\\nDavenport was a strong favourite for the US Open but, hampered by injury, lost to the powerful and unflappable Kuznetsova in the semis. Kuznetsova went on to give Dementieva another Grand Slam final thrashing, with the latter\\'s wayward serve becoming one of the talking points of the year. With the Russians still improving, the likes of Henin-Hardenne, Clijsters, Davenport, Mauresmo, Venus and Serena will need to be fully fit and motivated in 2005. And it may take their compatriot Safin to challenge Federer on the men\\'s side.\\nFederer breezes into semi-finals\\n\\nRoger Federer reached the last four of the Qatar Open with an easy 6-1 6-2 win over seventh seed Feliciano Lopez.\\n\\nThe Swiss world number one reeled off a series winners to outclass the Spaniard and set up a semi-final match against Russian Nikolay Davydenko. Federer, who lost in the quarter-final in his last Qatar appearance in 2003, was happy with his form. \"I think I played better than against Greg Rusedski and I am happy I am playing so well,\" said the top seed. Lopez showed glimpses of resolve early in the second set when he held his first service game and came close to breaking Federer. But the Swiss saved a break point and promptly broke serve in the following game to seize control. Davydenko, meanwhile, upset French third seed Sebastien Grosjean 2-6 6-3 6-2. Fabrice Santoro completed a miserable day for France when he was forced to retire when 6-2 3-0 down to Albert Costa. Spaniard Costa will next face Croatian Ivan Ljubicic after the sixth seed beat Rafael Nadal 6-2 6-7 (3/7) 6-3.\\nSharapova overcomes tough Molik\\n\\nWimbledon champion Maria Sharapova recovered from losing the opening set to win the final of the Qatar Open.\\n\\nThe second seed beat fourth-seeded Australian Alicia Molik 4-6 6-1 6-4 for her second title of the year. Molik, who had overcome top seed Amelie Mauresmo in Friday\\'s semi-final, broke Sharapova in the third game of a first set she went on to win. But Sharapova recovered to build up a healthy 5-0 lead in the second set and she never looked back after that. Molik saw her game fall apart as Sharapova broke in the fifth game of the decider to lead 3-2. And although Molik stayed in touch, Sharapova held on to her serve and then finished off the match with an ace after saving a break point in the 10th game.\\n\\nSharapova said the key to her victory was her positive approach after losing the first set. \"Alicia was dictating terms to me in the first set but in my mind I was always positive,\" said Sharapova. \"In the first set I was not playing my own game, but in the second I decided to put some pace on the ball and put pressure on her serve and that worked.\" Sharapova said she will head to Los Angeles to be with her mother and have some rest after her recent hectic schedule. \"I need some rest now and I am eager to see my mum and catch up with friends after all the travelling I\\'ve been doing.\"\\nSafin plays down Wimbledon hopes\\n\\nNewly-crowned Australian Open champion Marat Safin has ruled out any chance of winning Wimbledon in the future.\\n\\nAfter losing in round one last year, Safin said he had \"given up\" on Wimbledon and winning his second Grand Slam title has not changed his mind. \"I\\'ll play, but with no expectations. I feel like I can\\'t waste my time, my energy on that surface,\" he said. \"Some people, they cannot play on clay. Some people, they cannot play on a hard court. Me, I can\\'t play on grass.\" However, Safin is hopeful that winning the Australian Open will give him the belief he needs to win more Grand Slam titles. \"It\\'s a relief for me. Two grand slams, it\\'s already something. But with this one I worked really hard for it,\" he said. \"Basically, I would love to win a couple more. I think I have a chance if I continue this way.\\n\\n\"If (coach) Peter Lundgren will stick around with me and wants to work with me for a bit longer, I think I can make it.\" The 25-year-old shocked Pete Sampras in the 2000 US Open final to win his first major title but then lost in two Australian Open finals. Safin admitted he had begun to doubt whether he would win another Grand Slam. \"I didn\\'t expect that (to win the 2000 US Open) - it was against Sampras, I wasn\\'t the favourite so I had no pressure whatsoever,\" he said. \"After the first final that I didn\\'t win against Thomas Johansson (in 2002), I couldn\\'t see myself winning the Grand Slams anymore. \"I was once in the semi-finals of the French Open, but I didn\\'t believe I can win it. \"I just couldn\\'t handle the pressure. You need to believe in yourself, and I didn\\'t.\"\\n\\nAnd after losing the first set 6-1 to Lleyton Hewitt in Sunday\\'s final, Safin said he began to doubt himself again. \"I am 25. I\\'m playing against Hewitt. At least you have to have the opportunity to win it, at least have a chance,\" he said. \"It\\'s like you go there and you lose first set 6-1, then you start to think: \\'This is not my day. The way I\\'m playing is ridiculous.\\' \"But then you start to really be a little bit more selfish and try to find a way out of there. \"And I found it. I was like really much I was much happier than in 2000, that\\'s for sure, because I get over it.\"\\nSafin cool on Wimbledon\\n\\nNewly-crowned Australian Open champion Marat Safin has ruled out any chance of winning Wimbledon in the future.\\n\\nAfter losing in round one last year, Safin said he had \"given up\" on Wimbledon and winning his second Grand Slam title has not changed his mind. \"I\\'ll play, but with no expectations. I feel like I can\\'t waste my time, my energy on that surface,\" he said. \"Some people, they cannot play on clay. Some people, they cannot play on a hard court. Me, I can\\'t play on grass.\" However, Safin is hopeful that winning the Australian Open will give him the belief he needs to win more Grand Slam titles. \"It\\'s a relief for me. Two grand slams, it\\'s already something. But with this one I worked really hard for it,\" he said. \"Basically, I would love to win a couple more. I think I have a chance if I continue this way.\\n\\n\"If (coach) Peter Lundgren will stick around with me and wants to work with me for a bit longer, I think I can make it.\" The 25-year-old shocked Pete Sampras in the 2000 US Open final to win his first major title but then lost in two Australian Open finals. Safin admitted he had begun to doubt whether he would win another Grand Slam. \"I didn\\'t expect that (to win the 2000 US Open) - it was against Sampras, I wasn\\'t the favourite so I had no pressure whatsoever,\" he said. \"After the first final that I didn\\'t win against Thomas Johansson (in 2002), I couldn\\'t see myself winning the Grand Slams anymore. \"I was once in the semi-finals of the French Open, but I didn\\'t believe I can win it. \"I just couldn\\'t handle the pressure. You need to believe in yourself, and I didn\\'t.\"\\n\\nAnd after losing the first set 6-1 to Lleyton Hewitt in Sunday\\'s final, Safin said he began to doubt himself again. \"I am 25. I\\'m playing against Hewitt. At least you have to have the opportunity to win it, at least have a chance,\" he said. \"It\\'s like you go there and you lose first set 6-1, then you start to think: \\'This is not my day. The way I\\'m playing is ridiculous.\\' \"But then you start to really be a little bit more selfish and try to find a way out of there. \"And I found it. I was like really much I was much happier than in 2000, that\\'s for sure, because I get over it.\"\\nSoderling wins tense Milan final\\n\\nFifth seed Robin Soderling took the Milan Indoors title with a dramatic win over Radek Stepanek in Sunday\\'s final.\\n\\nThe 20-year-old Swede edged the final set tie-break for a 6-3 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (7-5) victory and his second tour title after winning in Lyon last year. \"I\\'m delighted to have won against such a good opponent in a tournament of this importance,\" said Soderling. \"I was really on form, my service was good and I really liked playing on the synthetic surface.\" Soderling, the world number 37, shrugged off a nervous start to take the opening set on his first set point. A change in approach from fourth seed Stepanek in the second set paid dividends as he took it on a tie-break, but Soderling\\'s superior power proved too much in the third.\\nHingis to make unexpected return\\n\\nMartina Hingis makes her return to competitve tennis after two years out of the game at the Volvo Women\\'s Open in Pattaya, Thailand, on Tuesday.\\n\\nShe faces German Marlene Weingartner in the first round. \"As a competitor and athlete, I always want to win. I hope my body will hold up,\" said Hingis. \"You miss being out there in a Grand Slam final and not competing. It\\'s a big difference between playing and commenting for TV. I miss it a lot.\" The former world number one was 22 when she retired after having surgery on both ankles, and her last WTA event was in Filderstadt, Germany, in October 2002, when she lost to Elena Dementieva. Only last year she insisted that a comeback was unlikely, but speaking in Thaliand Hingis admitted: \"I said that because I didn\\'t know what would happen with my body.\" Her appearance will also benefit charities in the region and the Swiss star will donate her prize money.\\nRoddick into San Jose final\\n\\nAndy Roddick will play Cyril Saulnier in the final of the SAP Open in San Jose on Sunday.\\n\\nThe American top seed and defending champion overcame Germany\\'s Tommy Haas, the third seed, 7-6 (7-3) 6-3. And Saulnier survived an injury scare in his semi-final with seventh-seeded Austrian Jurgen Melzer. The Frenchman twisted his ankle early in the second set but overcame Melzer, who was left fuming over a series of line calls, 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 6-3. \"I was feeling horrible earlier in the week,\" Roddick said. \"I thought tonight was another step in the right direction. \"On my returns, I was standing in more and I\\'m getting a little more depth, even if I don\\'t hit a perfect return.\"\\n\\nRoddick won the last four points of the first-set tie-break before being broken at the start of the second set. But he broke straight back and then broke Haas again to lead 4-2. \"It\\'s extremely frustrating when you have chances against a top-five player and don\\'t do anything with them,\" admitted Haas. \"I rushed a few backhands and he took advantage.\" Saulnier will move into the world\\'s top 50 for the first time after his passage through to the final. \"It\\'s taken a lot of work and a lot of fighting in my mind,\" he revealed. \"Sometimes I didn\\'t believe I could get to a final and now I am here. I\\'ve stayed mentally strong. \"I\\'m on the way. I\\'ll keep fighting and work a lot and I\\'ll be up there.\"\\nRoddick to face Saulnier in final\\n\\nAndy Roddick will play Cyril Saulnier in the final of the SAP Open in San Jose on Sunday.\\n\\nThe American top seed and defending champion overcame Germany\\'s Tommy Haas, the third seed, 7-6 (7-3) 6-3. \"I was feeling horrible earlier in the week,\" Roddick said. \"I thought tonight was a step in the right direction.\" Saulnier battled to a 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 6-3 win over seventh seed Jurgen Melzer, who twisted his ankle early in the second set. Roddick won the last four points of the first-set tie-break before being broken at the start of the second set. But he broke straight back and then broke Haas again to lead 4-2. \"It\\'s extremely frustrating when you have chances against a top-five player and don\\'t do anything with them,\" admitted Haas. \"I rushed a few backhands and he took advantage.\" Saulnier will move into the world\\'s top 50 for the first time after his passage through to the final. \"It\\'s taken a lot of work and a lot of fighting in my mind,\" he revealed. \"Sometimes I didn\\'t believe I could get to a final and now I am here. I\\'ve stayed mentally strong. \"I\\'m on the way. I\\'ll keep fighting and work a lot and I\\'ll be up there.\"\\nAgassi fear for Melbourne\\n\\nAndre Agassi\\'s involvement in the Australian Open was put in doubt after he pulled out of the Kooyong Classic with a hip injury.\\n\\nAgassi was serving at 5-6 down in the first set to fellow American Andy Roddick when he decided to bring a premature end to the match. \"My hip was cramping and I just could not continue,\" said the 34-year-old. Agassi, who has won the Australian Open four times, will have an MRI scan to discover the extent of the damage. He said the problem was not the same as the hip injury which forced him to miss Wimbledon last year.\\n\\n\"The good news is that it didn\\'t just tear, it was tightening up and that can be your body protecting itself, which is hopefully more of the issue,\" he added. \"That wasn\\'t comfortable out there at all, what I was feeling. \"I have to wait and see what I\\'m dealing with - it\\'s a pretty scary feeling out there when something doesn\\'t feel right and is getting worse. \"It\\'s very disappointing and I\\'ll have to do my best to deal with it. Time will shortly tell if it (the Australian Open) is a possibility or not. \"I was not counting on this being the end of the day for me. \"Maybe in a few days I\\'ll have a much better sense of what my hopes will be.\"\\nAgassi into second round in Dubai\\n\\nFourth seed Andre Agassi beat Radek Stepanek 6-4 7-5 in the first round of the Dubai Tennis Championships.\\n\\nThe 34-year-old, moving well despite a hip problem which needed an injection, served well and won 80% of his first serve and 76% of his second. But the American could not break the Czech Stepanek until the final game of the first set and in the second he had to fight back after losing his serve. Agassi, making his first appearance at the event, received a standing ovation. He said: \"I have had a few great days here in Dubai. I have waited a long time to be here, and I must apologise for being so late.\" Other first-day winners included Spaniards Juan Carlos Ferrero and Tommy Robredo, Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia and Germany\\'s Rainer Schuettler. Ferrero, the 2001 champion, overcame Florian Mayer of Germany 6-3 6-4 while Robredo had to fight hard to beat Olivier Rochus of Belgium 7-6 (7-5) 7-6 (7-5). Hrbaty crushed Omar Bahrouzyan of the United Arab Emirates 6-0 6-4 while Schuettler beat Younes Al Aynaoui of Morocco 6-0 6-1. Ferrero could now meet top seed Roger Federer - who faces qualifier Ivo Minar on Tuesday - in the second round. British rivals Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski will face each other in the opening round on Tuesday.\\nMirza makes Indian tennis history\\n\\nTeenager Sania Mirza completed a superb week at the Hyderabad Open by becoming the first Indian in history to win a WTA singles title.\\n\\nIn front of a delirious home crowd, the 18-year-old battled past Alyona Bondarenko of the Ukraine 6-4 5-7 6-3. Mirza, ranked 134 in the world, sunk to her knees in celebration after serving out the match against Bondarenko. \"It is a big moment in my career and I would like to thank everyone who has been a part of my effort,\" she said. \"This win has made me believe more in myself and I can now hope to do better in the coming days. \"I wanted to win this tournament very badly since it was in my hometown.\" At the Australian Open in January, Mirza became the first Indian woman to reach the third round of a Grand Slam before losing to eventual champion Serena Williams.\\n\\nAnd a year ago, she became the youngest Indian to win a professional title by claiming the doubles at the Hyderabad Open. Mirza, playing in her first WTA final, began nervously in front of a raucous home crowd - committing three double faults in her opening service game. But from 0-2 down, Mirza broke serve twice in a row and held on to her advantage to take the first set. In a see-saw second set, Bondarenko raced into a 5-2 lead and though Mirza hauled herself level, the Ukrainian broke again before finally levelling the match. Mirza rediscovered the aggressive strokes that took her to the first set in the decider established a 5-2 lead. At 5-3, the stadium erupted in celebration when Mirza thought she had delivered an ace to secure victory but the serve was ruled to have clipped the net. Mirza eventually lost the point but to the relief of the crowd, she broke Bondarenko again in the next game to clinch the title.\\nGB players warned over security\\n\\nBritain\\'s Davis Cup players have been warned not to go out of their Tel Aviv hotel unaccompanied ahead of the weekend\\'s tie against Israel.\\n\\nA suicide bombing in a nightclub in the city on Friday claimed four victims. \"We spoke about the bomb and we were told that we must not leave the hotel on our own,\" Andrew Murray told the Daily Telegraph. \"Jeremy (Bates, GB captain) told us to be careful when we go out of the hotel and not to do anything stupid.\" But Murray insisted that the team, which also includes Greg Rusedski, Arvind Parmar, David Sherwood and reserve Alex Bogdanovic, has been able to concentrate on the task ahead. \"The bomb went off just a few miles from where we are staying,\" said 17-year-old Murray.\\n\\n\"I will try not to think about what happened but I don\\'t think it will have any effect on the British team\\'s concentration. We will be safe if we stay in the hotel and the tennis centre.\" Speaking on Saturday, team captain Bates said: \"It was a terrible thing, a very unfortunate thing, but I think that sport must go on. \"I think that there are a lot of people involved in this event who have obviously taken great care to make sure the event runs smoothly.\" An LTA statement said: \"We have every confidence in the organisation and security of this tie. \"We will continue to monitor the situation carefully.\" The team arrived in Tel Aviv on Saturday and practised on the hard courts at the Ramat Hasharon arena on Sunday.\\nCapriati out of Australian Open\\n\\nJennifer Capriati has become the third leading lady to withdraw from the Australian Open because of injury.\\n\\nThe organisers of the first grand slam of 2005, which begins on 17 January, said the American has a problem with her right shoulder. It comes as a blow to the women\\'s draw as last year\\'s champion, Justin Henin-Hardenne, and runner-up, Kim Clijsters, will also be absent. Capriati is a two-time champion in Melbourne with wins in 2001 and 2002. She is believed to have picked up the injury at the Advanta Championships at Philadelphia in November and had to pull out of an exhibition match with Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova on 17 December. Capriati also decided against competing in the Australian Open warm-up event, the Sydney International.\\nSerena becomes world number two\\n\\nSerena Williams has moved up five places to second in the world rankings after her Australian Open win.\\n\\nWilliams won her first Grand Slam title since 2003 with victory over Lindsay Davenport, the world number one. Men\\'s champion Marat Safin remains fourth in the ATP rankings while beaten finalist Lleyton Hewitt replaces Andy Roddick as world number two. Roger Federer retains top spot, but Safin has overtaken Hewitt to become the new leader of the Champions Race. Alicia Molik, who lost a three-set thriller against Davenport in the quarter-finals, is in the women\\'s top 10 for the first time in her career. Her rise means Australia have a player in the top 10 of the men\\'s and women\\'s rankings for the first time in 21 years. And Britain\\'s Elena Baltacha, who qualified and then reached the third round, has risen to 120 in the world - a leap of 65 places and her highest ranking yet.\\nInjury sidelines Philippoussis\\n\\nMark Philippoussis withdrew from the Sydney International tennis tournament as expected on Sunday after suffering a groin injury during the Hopman Cup.\\n\\nHis participation in the Australian Open, which begins on 17 January in Melbourne, also remains in doubt. Defending women\\'s champion Justine Henin-Hardenne is also out of the Sydney event because of a knee injury. In the only main draw men\\'s or women\\'s singles match on Sunday, Nathalie Dechy beat American Lisa Raymond 7-5 6-3. Number one men\\'s seed Lleyton Hewitt begins his quest for a fourth Sydney title on Tuesday when he plays Karol Beck. Lindsay Davenport, top seed in the women\\'s draw, has been handed a first-round bye and plays France\\'s Dechy in the second round on Tuesday.\\nWilliams battles to Aussie title\\n\\nSerena Williams staged a remarkable recovery to beat Lindsay Davenport and win her second Australian Open title.\\n\\nThe 2003 champion claimed her seventh Grand Slam title, and her first since Wimbledon in 2003, 2-6 6-3 6-0. Williams had looked close to quitting with a rib injury when she left the court for treatment after five games. She quickly dropped the first set but from 3-3 in the second found another gear as Davenport\\'s game collapsed, allowing Williams to take the title. Williams later explained her injury problem, saying it was the result of lunging for a ball early in the first set. \"Lindsay had me on the run out wide on my backhand and my back went but eventually I was able to come back, thank goodness,\" she said. Davenport paid tribute to Williams, saying: \"She\\'s had a tough couple of years and she\\'s come back like a champion.\"\\n\\nThe 23-year-old former world number one was in desperate trouble in the early stages as the injury hampered her service action. Davenport took advantage to race through the opening set and held six break points in game five of the second. \"I kept thinking to myself \\'I\\'m not losing this game,\" said Williams afterwards. \"\\'I don\\'t care if my arm falls off, I\\'m not losing this game\\'. And I guess that\\'s what happened. \"I didn\\'t want to lose that particular game because it would have given her a lot of momentum, and a lot of confidence.\" Despite letting the break points slip away Davenport looked comfortable enough at 3-3, but from 40-0 up she just folded. Williams won nine consecutive points for the set and powered through the decider as a lacklustre Davenport looked to have run out of energy after a gruelling two weeks. \"I felt like I was playing well and in control pretty much of the match,\" said Davenport. \"Then I just had that horrible lapse, I think serving up 40-0, and made a few errors and opened up the door for her and she just kept going through it. \"At the end I think I was a little bit fatigued but she took advantage of it and kept going - she\\'s a great frontrunner when she gets going.\"\\nRoche \\'turns down Federer offer\\'\\n\\nAustralian tennis coach Tony Roche has turned down an approach from Roger Federer to be the world number one\\'s new full-time coach, say reports.\\n\\nMelbourne\\'s Herald-Sun said Roche, troubled by a hip complaint, did not want to travel full-time again. However, Roche is happy to work with the Swiss star on a casual basis and is helping him prepare for next month\\'s defence of his Australian Open crown. Federer has been without a coach since splitting with Peter Lundgren in 2003. Roche, a former Davis Cup player for Australia, won the French Open, reached the Wimbledon and US Open finals and won five Wimbledon doubles titles with John Newcombe.\\n\\nHe also coached former number one Ivan Lendl and Pat Rafter to Grand Slam victories and has worked with Australia\\'s Lleyton Hewitt. Some reports claim Federer initially wanted Andre Agassi\\'s Australian coach Darren Cahill, before Agassi confirmed he would play on in 2005. Federer was named Swiss sportsman of the year on Saturday, to add to the BBC overseas sportsman and European Sports Journalists Association awards he has already won.\\nJohansson takes Adelaide victory\\n\\nSecond seed Joachim Johansson won his second career title with a 7-5 6-3 win over Taylor Dent at the Australian hardcourt championships in Adelaide.\\n\\nThe Swede was made to graft, American Dent surviving three break points in the fifth game of the match. But Johansson got the breakthrough with a sublime backhand return winner and won the second set with more ease. His first tournament win was at Memphis in 2004, helping him leap from 113th in the world rankings to number 11. Afterwards, Dent said he rated US Open semi-finalist Johansson as a top contender at the Australian Open, which starts on 17 January. \"I believe men\\'s tennis is all about holding serve and if he\\'s playing like that on his own serve I don\\'t see how guys are going to break him,\" said Dent. Johansson was more restrained in his assessment: \"I have to improve my serve if I\\'m going to go all the way in Melbourne.\"\\nMoya emotional at Davis Cup win\\n\\nCarlos Moya described Spain\\'s Davis Cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat Andy Roddick to end the USA\\'s challenge in Seville.\\n\\nMoya made up for missing Spain\\'s 2000 victory through injury by beating Roddick 6-2 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-5) to give the hosts an unassailable 3-1 lead. \"I have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day,\" said Moya. \"All my energy has been focused on today. \"What I have lived today I do not think I will live again.\" Spain\\'s only other Davis Cup title came two years ago in Valencia, when they beat Australia. And Moya, nicknamed Charly, admitted: \"The Davis Cup is my dream and I was a bit nervous at the outset. \"Some people have said that I am obsessed but I think that it is better this way. It helps me reach my goals if I am obsessed. \"It\\'s really incredible - to get the winning point is really something.\" Spanish captain Jordi Arrese said: \"Charly played a great game. It was his opportunity and he hasn\\'t let us down. \"He had lost three times to Roddick, and this was his day to beat him. \"He had been waiting years to be in this position.\" Spain\\'s victory was also remarkable for the performance of Rafael Nadal, who beat Roddick in the opening singles.\\n\\nAged 18 years and 185 days, the Mallorcan became the youngest player to win the Davis Cup. \"What a great way to finish the year,\" said Nadal afterwards. US coach Patrick McEnroe wants Roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface. \"I think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better.\" \"Obviously it\\'s unrealistic to say that we\\'re going to just start playing constantly on clay, with the schedule. \"But certainly I think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff,\" said McEnroe. Roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of Seville\\'s Olympic Stadium. \"It\\'s just tough because I felt like I was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay-courters in the world,\" said the American. \"I had my chances and just didn\\'t convert them. The bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend. \"They came out, took care of business and they beat us. It\\'s as simple as that.\"\\nOfficials respond in court row\\n\\nAustralian tennis\\' top official has defended the Australian Open courts at Melbourne Park after criticism of the playing surface by Lleyton Hewitt.\\n\\nHewitt said he had had a \"gutful\" of trying to persuade them to make the surface faster but Tennis Australia\\'s Geoff Pollard rejected his comments. \"We did ask for it to be made faster than last year and, to my knowledge, it is faster,\" he said. \"We spent a substantial amount of money on modifications to make it faster.\" Hewitt, who has not got past the fourth round at Melbourne in seven attempts, had earlier said the surface was not worthy of such a prestigious tournament. But he said he would play on whatever surface he had to in order to have a chance of winning. The tournament starts on 17 January, and Pollard said the surface had been speeded up since last year\\'s tournament following complaints by several Australian players. But he refused to accept that the Melbourne surface may have had a bearing on Hewitt\\'s performances over the years. \"Lleyton\\'s proving how versatile he is on all surfaces,\" he said. \"It is faster than last year and that\\'ll be faster than the one Lleyton beat Roger Federer on in the Davis Cup in 2003.\"\\nAustralia miss Molik for Fed Cup\\n\\nAustralia will be without their leading player Alicia Molik for the Fed Cup round robin matches in India in April.\\n\\nThe world number 10 was not included in new captain John Alexander\\'s squad as she is focusing on her singles career. \"Alicia has a real opportunity to achieve a number one world ranking and has a particular schedule designed to achieve that,\" Alexander explained. World number 46 Samantha Stosur, plus Nicole Pratt, Evie Dominikovic and Bryanne Stewart form the squad. Alexander insisted that the team was fully behind Molik\\'s request not to play. \"The Fed Cup is an awkward date and the geographical location for these first events and really would have stuffed up the first part of her year,\" he said. \"When all things are considered Tennis Australia has to consider looking after our players holistically and when someone has a great opportunity like this, we have to be behind them.\" China, Taiwan, India, Korea, New Zealand, Singapore and Kazakhstan are the other nations competing in New Delhi from 18-24 April.\\nHenman & Murray claim LTA awards\\n\\nTim Henman was named player of the year for 2004 by the Lawn Tennis Association at Wimbledon on Monday.\\n\\nThe Briton was recognised for the best year of his career, which saw him reach the semis at the French and US Opens. Scotland\\'s Andrew Murray was named young player of the year after winning the US Open juniors, as well as a Futures event in Italy. And world number one Peter Norfolk won disabled player of the year after claiming his third US Open crown.\\n\\nGreat Britain\\'s under 14 boys won the team of the year prize for their victory at the World Junior Tennis event in August. Henman will start his 2005 campaign at the Kooyong event on 12 January in a field that includes Roger Federer, Andy Roddick and Andre Agassi. And the Briton is optimistic of surpassing his best effort of a fourth-round place at the Australian Open, which begins the following week. \"I\\'ve often felt that the conditions suit my game in Melbourne so I\\'d love to be able to start next year by doing well at the Australian Open,\" Henman told his website. \"That\\'s why I\\'ve changed my schedule slightly by committing to play in the Kooyong Classic. \"I\\'ll be able to acclimatise while practising before the event and then will be guaranteed matches against the best players in the world. \"I think that will give me the best possible chance of doing well at the Australian Open.\"\\nMoya emotional after Davis Cup win\\n\\nCarlos Moya described Spain\\'s Davis Cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat Andy Roddick to end the USA\\'s challenge in Seville.\\n\\nMoya made up for missing Spain\\'s 2000 victory through injury by beating Roddick 6-2 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-5) to give the hosts an unassailable 3-1 lead. \"I have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day,\" said Moya. \"All my energy has been focused on today. \"What I have lived today I do not think I will live again.\" Spain\\'s only other Davis Cup title came two years ago in Valencia, when they beat Australia.

It\\'s as simple as that.\"\\nMurray to make Cup history\\n\\nAndrew Murray will become Britain\\'s youngest-ever Davis Cup player after it was confirmed he will play in the doubles against Israel on Saturday.\\n\\nThe 17-year-old will play alongside fellow debutant David Sherwood against Israel\\'s Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram. Murray will eclipse the record set by Roger Becker back in 1952. Greg Rusedski takes Tim Henman\\'s place as first choice in the singles, while Alex Bogdanovic will play in the second singles clash. Rusedski will take on former world number 30 Harel Levy and Bogdanovic - who has previously played in two singles rubbers against Australia - will face Noam Okun.\\n\\nMurray is the brightest young hope in British tennis, after winning the US Open junior title last year and the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year. British number one Tim Henman, who announced his Davis Cup retirement earlier this year, believes Britain can win the tie in Tel Aviv. \"It\\'s going to be as really tough match. Israel have some really good players - and their doubles pair of Andy Ram and Jonathan Erlich are among the top eight in the world - but I fancy our chances,\" he said. But Henman urged Bogdanovic, who has had run-ins with British tennis officials in the past, to seize his chance. \"Alex is a quality player - he\\'s young but he\\'s got to keep pushing forward. \"He\\'s got to be stronger, he\\'s got a lot of ability but he\\'s got to be more disciplined mentally and physically and if he does that he\\'s got a good chance.\"\\nKuznetsova \\'failed a drugs test\\'\\n\\nUS Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova has tested positive for a banned drug, according to Belgian authorities.\\n\\nBelgian sports minister Claude Eerdekens said that the Russian world number five tested positive for the stimulant ephedrine on 19 December. Kuznetsova was playing in an exhibition event in Charleroi at the time. Eerdekens said: \"There is a problem. Ephedrine was discovered. She remains innocent until proved guilty. She can ask for it to be tested again.\" The situation remains unclear as the tournament was not commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), the International Tennis Federation (ITF) or the Women\\'s Tennis Accosiation (WTA). The test was carried out by regional Belgian authorities and Kuznetsova has not yet been able to have a B sample tested.\\n\\nSpeaking at the Australian Open on Monday, before Eerdekens identified her, Kuznetsova said: \"I\\'m not worried. I\\'m not using anything to push myself. \"I have not been notified of any positive test, and I think it is unfair that it\\'s come out the way it did.\" Eerdekens said that confirmation of the findings was sent last Friday to the player\\'s address in Spain, as well as to the Belgian prosecutors\\' office and the Belgian and Russian tennis federations. He conceded Kuznetsova might have taken a medicine which contained the banned substance. \"We have simply stated a fact,\" he said. \"It is for the federation concerned to impose the disciplinary measures after a procedure that respects the defence.\\n\\n\"Either the ephedrine was taken to improve her performance or it is because she took some medicine legitimately to cure an infection.\" However, Kuznetsova\\'s naming was condemned by Russian tennis chief Shamil Tarpishchev. \"First of all, this Belgian sports minister has broken every ethical rule in the book by naming a player without any proof of wrongdoing, without any basic evidence,\" Tarpishchev said. \"We all know the basic principle in doping cases. If there is a positive sample, then they should notify the International Tennis Federation (ITF) as well as the national federation within three days,\" he said. \"This is not the case here. As of today we have not received any statement from the doping officials, nor did the ITF. \"Today I called the ITF headquarters and they told me they know nothing about it. \"If WADA (the World Anti-Doping Agency) was behind the testing, then we would also have known something by now. \"Otherwise, all these looks to me as pure fiction and fabrication of the facts.\"\\nHenman hopes ended in Dubai\\n\\nThird seed Tim Henman slumped to a straight sets defeat in his rain-interrupted Dubai Open quarter-final against Ivan Ljubicic.\\n\\nThe Croatian eighth seed booked his place in the last four with a 7-5 6-4 victory over the British number one. Henman had looked on course to level the match after going 2-0 up in the second set, but his progress was halted as the rain intervened again. Ljubicic hit back after the break to seal a fourth straight win over Henman. Earlier in the day, Spanish fifth seed Tommy Robredo secured his semi-final place when he beat Nicolas Kiefer of Germany 6-4 6-4. Afterwards, Henman was left cursing the weather and the umpire after seven breaks for rain during the match. \"It was incredibly frustrating,\" Henman said. \"It\\'s raining and the umpire doesn\\'t take control. \"He kept telling us to play till the end of the game. But if it\\'s raining, you come off - the score\\'s irrelevant. \"It couldn\\'t be more frustrating as I was very happy with my form until now. You don\\'t expect this in the desert.\"\\nVenus stunned by Farina Elia\\n\\nVenus Williams suffered a first-round defeat for the first time in four years at the Dubai Championships.\\n\\nSylvia Farina Elia, who had lost all nine of her previous meetings with the American fifth seed, won 7-5 7-6 (8-6). Former Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez and India\\'s Sania Mirza, the oldest and youngest players in the draw, also reached the second round. Martinez, 32, beat Shinobu Asagoe 6-4 6-4 and 18-year-old Mirza beat Jelena Kostanic 6-7 (7-2) 6-4 6-1. Mirza, the first Indian woman to win a WTA Tour title this month on home ground at Hyderabad, will now face US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova.\\n\\nBut she is remaining confident. \"She (Kuznetsova) is a great player,\" she said. \"But everyone is beatable and I am looking forward to a great match.\" Williams though blamed her defeat by Farina Elia on injuries. \"Blisters were a factor, but mostly my stomach wasn\\'t that great,\" she said. \"I did it in the last tournament in the semi-finals, and I was serving at 40% in the final. \"The first time I served again was Sunday and there wasn\\'t a lot I could do out there. When your serve isn\\'t good it throws the rest of your game off too.\" She will wait to see how she recovers before deciding whether to take part in the Nasdaq-100 Open in Miami, starting on 21 March.\\nWhat now for British tennis?\\n\\nTim Henman\\'s decision to quit Davis Cup tennis has left the British team with a gargantuan void to fill.\\n\\nThe world number seven is tied for fourth among his countrymen for wins in the history of the tournament (he has 36 from his 50 rubbers). And Great Britain\\'s last Davis Cup win without Henman came against Slovenia as far back as 1996. Worse could follow, according to former British team member Chris Bailey. Bailey told BBC Sport: \"After Tim\\'s announcement, I doubt Greg Rusedski will be that far behind him.\" But without their top two, where does that leave British ambitions in the sport\\'s premier team event? Captain Jeremy Bates has singled out Alex Bogdanovic and Andrew Murray as potential replacements. The Yugoslavian-born Bogdanovic, though, is 184 places below Henman in the world rankings and has played just two cup ties - winning one and losing the other.\\n\\nMurray, on the other hand, is 407th in the current ATP entry list and yet to make his cup debut. But Bailey does see some hope for the future. He said: \"Now we\\'ve dropped down to the Euro-Africa zone, the time was right for him to step down and let the young guys come to the fore.\" Britain\\'s next opponents, Israel, are hardly likely to be quaking in their boots ahead of the 4-6 March match against a likely trio of Bogdanovic, Murray and the 187th-ranked Arvind Parmar. Bailey said: \"It will be tough for GB to move up, but there comes a time when our young players have to step up. This was always going to be inevitable with Tim and Greg\\'s growing years. \"I\\'m confident about the future. I wouldn\\'t lay money on us getting back into the world group next year, but I\\'d imagine in five years time we\\'ll be competing for the major honours.\" Of those lining up to replace Henman, the 17-year-old Murray, with four Futures titles under his belt last year, looks the best long-term bet. \"Murray is the one that looks likeliest to take over Tim\\'s mantle,\" said Bailey. \"He has an enormous amount of self-confidence, judging by what he\\'s said in the past.\" Bogdanovic, three years Murray\\'s senior, has had a more troubled time under Britain\\'s Davis Cup umbrella.\\n\\nWhile Murray has been marked out as Britain\\'s golden boy, Bogdanovic was warned by the Lawn Tennis Association for a lack of drive at the end of 2003. And Bailey said: \"Despite that, Alex is clearly talented as well, while Arvind is another contender. \"They\\'re among the guys who have experienced the intensity of Davis Cup tennis - whether as players or on the sidelines. \"The LTA has always done an exceptional job of ensuring that. \"Now they\\'ll finally get to play regularly in the cauldron of the cup. And I\\'m confident that will springboard Team GB to greater success.\"\\nSafin slumps to shock Dubai loss\\n\\nMarat Safin suffered a shock loss to unseeded Nicolas Kiefer in round one of the Dubai Tennis Championships.\\n\\nPlaying his first match since winning the Australian Open, Safin showed some good touches but was beaten 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 by the in-form Kiefer. The German got on top in the first-set tie-break, striking a sweet forehand to win the first point against serve. And he maintained the momentum early in the second set, breaking the Russian with the help of an inspired volley. Spain\\'s Feliciano Lopez lined up a second round clash with Andre Agassi by beating Thailand\\'s Paradorn Srichaphan. Lopez, who lost in three sets to Roger Federer in last year\\'s final, won 6-2 3-6 6-3. Former champion Fabrice Santoro of France was beaten 6-3 6-0 by sixth seeded Russian Nikolay Davydenko. There were also wins for two other Russians, Igor Andreev and seventh seed Mikhail Youzhny.\\nDementieva prevails in Hong Kong\\n\\nElena Dementieva swept aside defending champion Venus Williams 6-3 6-2 to win Hong Kong\\'s Champions Challenge event.\\n\\nThe Russian, ranked sixth in the world, broke Williams three times in the first set, while losing her service once. Williams saved three championship points before losing the match at the Victoria Park tennis court. \"It\\'s really a great start to the year no matter whether it\\'s an exhibition or not. I was trying to play my best and I really did it,\" said Dementieva. \"This will give me all the confidence before the Grand Slams. I was trying so hard to win this tournament.\" Williams, 24, was disappointed with her display. \"She played some nice points, but it was mostly me committing unforced errors - four or five errors in each game,\" she said. Before the match, organizers auctioned off rackets belonging to the players, raising £115,000 for victims of the tsunami disaster.\\nHantuchova in Dubai last eight\\n\\nDaniela Hantuchova moved into the quarter-finals of the Dubai Open, after beating Elene Likhotseva of Russia 7-5 6-4, and now faces Serena Williams.\\n\\nAustralian Open champion Williams survived an early scare to beat Russia\\'s Elena Bovina 1-6 6-1 6-4. World number one Lindsay Davenport and Anastasia Myskina also progressed. Davenport defeated China\\'s Jie Zheng 6-2 7-5, while French Open champion Myskina sailed through after her opponent Marion Bartoli retired hurt. American Davenport will now face fellow former Wimbledon champion, Conchita Martinez of Spain, who ousted seventh-seeded Nathalie Dechy of France 6-1 6-2. Myskina will face eighth-seed Patty Schnyder from Switzerland, who defeated China\\'s Li Na 6-3 7-6 (10-8). The other quarter final pits wild card Sania Mirza of India against Jelena Jankovic of Serbia and Montenegro, who both won on Tuesday.\\n\\nBefore her meeting with Martinez, Davenport believes there is some room for improvement in her game. \"I started well and finished well, but played some so-so games in the middle,\" she said. Williams was also far from content. \"I don\\'t know what I was doing there,\" she said. \"It was really windy and I hadn\\'t played in the wind. All my shots were going out of here.\" But Hantuchova is in upbeat mood ahead of her clash with the younger Williams sister, who was handed a first-round bye. \"I feel I have an advantage (over Serena) because I have already played two matches on these courts,\" she said. \"It is a difficult court to play on. Very fast and sometimes you feel you have no control over the ball.\"\\nHingis hints at playing comeback\\n\\nMartina Hingis has admitted that she might consider a competitive return to tennis if an appearance in Thailand later this month goes well.\\n\\nThe former world number one will play at the Volvo Women\\'s Open in Pattaya, which starts on 31 January, as part of her charity work in the region. \"The tournament is a test,\" she said. \"I don\\'t know how my body will react. \"I support several charities in Thailand. I\\'m also playing to see where I am.\" Speaking to Le Matin, the 24-year-old Swiss added: \"At Pattaya there will not be as many people and the players are ranked between the 30th and 95th in the world.\" Hingis was 22 when she retired after having surgery on both ankles, and her last WTA event was in Filderstadt, Germany, in October 2002, when she lost to Elena Dementieva.\\nMoya sidesteps Davis Cup in 2005\\n\\nCarlos Moya has chosen not to help Spain try and defend the Davis Cup crown they won in Seville in November.\\n\\nMoya led Spain to victory over the USA but wants to focus on the Grand Slams in 2005, although insists he will return to the Davis Cup in 2006. \"After two years of total commitment with the Davis Cup team... I have taken this difficult decision to concentrate on the regular circuit,\" said Moya. \"They know that after this season they can count on me again if they so wish.\" The 1998 French Open champion is determined to make an impact in the major events after spending much of the last eight years in the top 10. \"At the age of 29 I have set some tough goals in my professional career and this season I need to fix my objectives on specific dates and tournaments,\" he said. \"Since the Davis Cup in Seville I have been working on my condition as well as technical and medical aspects of my game which will allow me to come into the big events of the year in top form.\"\\n\\nMoya began 2005 with victory in the Chennai Open on Sunday.\\nFederer wins title in Rotterdam\\n\\nWorld number one Roger Federer won the World Indoor Tournament in Rotterdam with a battling 5-7 7-5 7-6 victory over Ivan Ljubicic on Sunday.\\n\\nThe Swiss star was made to work hard by Ljubicic, who also lost to Federer in last month\\'s final in Doha. The Croatian broke his serve for the first time in the tournament to take the first set, but Federer hit back and took the decider on a tie-break. He has now won his last 15 finals after triumphing in two hours and 42 minutes. Federer said: \"Today it was very close and it could have gone either way but I\\'m happy I fought through because this might be a crucial victory for me for the rest of the season. \"I knew I had to fight hard today and that\\'s exactly what happened. \"I played one shocking game to be broken. He took advantage of it and broke me to love but I still felt I gave that game away. \"That haunted me all the way, right until match point. I fought well today so I\\'m happy.\"\\nFederer claims Dubai crown\\n\\nWorld number one Roger Federer added the Dubai Championship trophy to his long list of successes - but not before he was given a test by Ivan Ljubicic.\\n\\nTop seed Federer looked to be on course for a easy victory when he thumped the eighth seed 6-1 in the first set. But Ljubicic, who beat Tim Henman in the last eight, dug deep to secure the second set after a tense tiebreak. Swiss star Federer was not about to lose his cool, though, turning on the style to win the deciding set 6-3. The match was a re-run of last week\\'s final at the World Indoor Tournament in Rotterdam, where Federer triumphed, but not until Ljubicic had stretched him for five sets. \"I really wanted to get off to a good start this time, and I did, and I could really play with confidence while he still looking for his rhythm,\" Federer said.\\n\\n\"That took me all the way through to 6-1 3-1 0-30 on his serve and I almost ran away with it. But he came back, and that was a good effort on his side.\" Ljubicic was at a loss to explain his poor showing in the first set. \"I didn\\'t start badly, but then suddenly I felt like my racket was loose and the balls were flying a little bit too much. And with Roger, if you relax for a second it just goes very quick,\" he said. \"After those first three games it was no match at all. I don\\'t know, it was really weird. I was playing really well the whole year, and then suddenly I found myself in trouble just to put the ball in the court.\" But despite his defeat, the world number 14 was pleased with his overall performance. \"I had a chance in the third, and for me it\\'s really positive to twice in two weeks have a chance against Roger to win the match. \"It\\'s an absolutely great boost to my confidence that I\\'m up there and belong with top-class players.\"\\nMartinez sees off Vinci challenge\\n\\nVeteran Spaniard Conchita Martinez came from a set down to beat Italian Roberta Vinci at the Qatar Open in Doha.\\n\\nThe 1994 Wimbledon champion won 5-7 6-0 6-2 to earn a second round meeting with French Open champion Anastasia Myskina. Fifth seed Patty Schnyder also had a battle as she needed three sets to beat China\\'s Na Li 7-5 3-6 7-5. Slovakian Daniela Hantuchova beat Bulgarian Magdaleena Maleeva 4-6 6-4 6-3 to set up a second round clash with Russian Elena Bovina. The veteran Martinez found herself in trouble early on against Vinci with the Italian clinching the set thanks to breaks in the third and 11th games. But Vinci\\'s game fell to pieces after that and Martinez swept her aside with some crisp cross-court returns and deft volleys. In the day\\'s other matches, Japan\\'s Ai Sugiyama defeated Australian Samantha Stosur 6-2 6-3 while Australian Nicole Pratt beat Tunisian Selima Sfar 7-5 6-2 and will next face compatriot Alicia Molik.\\nRusedski forced out in Marseille\\n\\nGreg Rusedski was forced to withdraw from the Open 13 in Marseille on Thursday with a rib injury.\\n\\nThe British number two had been scheduled to play qualifier Sebastien de Chaunac, who beat world number five Guillermo Coria 6-4 7-5 in round one. But Rusedski was unable to take to the court because of a problem with the left-hand side of his rib-cage. American Taylor Dent caused a shock with a 7-6 6-2 victory over second seed David Nalbandian. But third seed Joachim Johansson made it through after beating Frenchman Gilles Simon 7-6 6-3 while in the first match of the day, sixth seed Feliciano Lopez defeated Ivo Karlovic. There were also wins for Slovakia\\'s Karol Beck and Croatian duo Ivan Ljubicic and Mario Ancic.\\nConnors boost for British tennis\\n\\nFormer world number one Jimmy Connors is planning a long-term relationship with the Lawn Tennis Association to help unearth the next Tim Henman.\\n\\nThe American spent three days at the LTA\\'s annual Elite Performance winter camp in La Manga earlier this week. \"Britain has the right attitude,\" said Connors. \"The more involved I can be with the LTA, the better. \"A short-term arrangement is just confusing. The kids will ask: \\'What am I doing there?\\'\" LTA chief executive, John Crowther, added: \"The relationship that Jimmy\\'s already started to develop with the coaches and the players has said to us that we\\'d like some more of it. \"We want to use Jimmy for a number of weeks a year and we hope this is the beginning of a good long-term relationship.\"\\n\\nThe camp played host to more than 30 leading senior and junior players, including Greg Rusedski, Arvind Parmar and Anne Keothavong. \"La Manga is an amazing site to take a bunch of kids who want to be the best,\" said Connors, speaking at Queen\\'s Club in London. \"What impressed me most was not only the coaches but the way the kids went about their workouts and the feeling they put into every practice they had. \"It was interesting to me to see kids of 15, 16, 17, with that desire and passion, and that can only be brought about by the coaches surrounding them. \"Instilling the importance of work and practice is something you can\\'t buy. \"They know what\\'s been given to them and all they have to do is give back the effort, and every minute of practice they were doing that.\"\\n\\nSpeaking from La Manga, LTA performance director David Felgate told BBC Sport: \"Jimmy was fantastic with the players and the coaches, and very humble considering what he\\'s achieved. \"He worked through the coaches and hopefully it will grow and he\\'ll get to have more of an individual relationship with some of the players and get to know them. \"He made it clear from the word go he didn\\'t want it to be short-term. This is a 52-week-a-year job for me, it\\'s my life and my passion and it\\'s the same with the coaches. \"He respects that but he wants to be involved and have real input. And why would he stake his reputation on something that\\'s not going to be successful?\" Connors has also agreed to commentate for the BBC at next year\\'s Wimbledon Championships. He will work during the second week of the tournament.\\nClijsters could play Aussie Open\\n\\nKim Clijsters has denied reports that she has pulled out of January\\'s Australian Open because of her persistent wrist injury.\\n\\nOpen chief Paul McNamee had said: \"Kim\\'s wrist obviously isn\\'t going to be rehabilitated.\" But her spokesman insisted she had simply delayed submitting her entry. \"The doctors are assessing her injury on a weekly basis and if there is no risk she could play. But if there\\'s the least risk she will stay away.\" Despite being absent from the WTA entry list for the tournament, which begins on 17 January, Clijsters would be certain to get a wild card if she requested one. Clijsters is still ranked 22nd in the world despite only playing a handful of matches last season. The Belgian had an operation on her left wrist early in the season but injured it again on her return to the tour. Meanwhile, Jelena Dokic, who used to compete for Australia, has opted out of the first Grand Slam of the season. Dokic has not played in the Australian Open since 2001 when she lost in the first round. But the 21-year-old would have had to rely on a wild card next season because her ranking has tumbled to 127th. Four-time champion Monica Seles, who has not played since last year\\'s French Open, is another absentee because of an injured left foot.\\nHenman decides to quit Davis Cup\\n\\nTim Henman has retired from Great Britain\\'s Davis Cup team.\\n\\nThe 30-year-old, who made his Davis Cup debut in 1994, is now set to fully focus on the ATP Tour and on winning his first Grand Slam event. \"I\\'ve made no secret of the fact that representing Great Britain has always been a top priority for me throughout my career,\" Henman told his website. Captain Jeremy Bates has touted Alex Bogdanovic and Andrew Murray as possible replacements for the veteran. Henman added that he was available to help Britain in its bid for Davis Cup success, with the next tie against Israel in March . \"Although I won\\'t be playing, I would still like to make myself available to both Jeremy and the LTA in the future so that I can draw upon my experience in the hope of trying to help the British players develop their full potential,\" he added. \"I\\'ve really enjoyed playing in front of the thousands of British fans both home and abroad and would like to thank every one of them for their unwavering support over the years.\" Henman leaves Davis Cup tennis with an impressive record, having won 36 of his 50 matches. Great Britain captain Jeremy Bates paid tribute to Henman\\'s efforts over the years.\\n\\n\"Tim has quite simply had a phenomenal Davis Cup career and it has been an absolute privilege to have captained the team with him in it,\" said Bates. \"Tim\\'s magnificent record speaks for itself. While it\\'s a great loss I completely understand and respect his decision to retire from Davis Cup and focus on the Grand Slams and Tour. \" \"Looking to the future this decision obviously marks a watershed in British Davis Cup tennis but it is also a huge opportunity for the next generation to make their mark. \"We have a host of talented players coming through and despite losing someone of Tim\\'s calibre, I remain very optimistic about the future.\" Henman made his Davis Cup debut in 1994 against Romania in Manchester. He and partner Bates won their doubles rubber on the middle Saturday of the tie. Britain eventually lost the contest 3-2. Henman and Britain had little luck in Davis Cup matches until 1999 when they qualified for the World Group. Britain drew the USA and lost the tie when Greg Rusedski fell to Jim Courier in the deciding rubber. They made the final stages again, in 2002, but this time lost out to the might of Sweden.\\nMoya suffers shock loss\\n\\nFifth seed Carlos Moya was the first big name to fall at the Australian Open as he went down to fellow Spaniard Guillermo Garcia-Lopez on Monday.\\n\\nMoya began the year with victory at the Chennai Open but looked out of sorts from the start in the Melbourne heat. Garcia-Lopez, ranked 106 in the world, dominated from the outset and withstood a third-set rally from Moya to hang on for a 7-5 6-3 3-6 6-3 victory. The 21-year-old plays Kevin Kim or Lee Hyuung-Taik in the second round. Garcia-Lopez was delighted with the victory in only his third ever Grand Slam match. \"I think this was the most important win of my life as Carlos is one of the best players in the world,\" he said. \"This has given me a lot of confidence. Now I feel I can beat all these players.\" Moya said: \"I was playing well before I came here. It was the perfect preparation but something was wrong today.\"\\n\\nFour-time champion Andre Agassi began what could be his last Australian Open with a convincing win over German qualifier Dieter Kindlmann. The 34-year-old American, who had been struggling with a hip injury earlier in the week, stormed to a 6-4 6-3 6-0 win. Agassi will play France\\'s Olivier Patience or Germany\\'s Rainer Schuettler - the man he beat in the 2003 final - in the next round. \"No one was more concerned (about the injury) than myself,\" said eighth seed Agassi. \"I\\'d worked hard to be down here and ready. But the last few days, I\\'ve pushed through the injury and it seemed to do pretty good.\" In other matches, world junior champion Gael Monfils made use of his wild card with a magnificent 1-6 6-3 6-4 7-6 (8-6) win over American Robby Ginepri. The 2002 champion Thomas Johansson fought back to beat Peter Luczak 7-6 (7-5) 4-6 6-3 4-6 6-0, and French Open champion Gaston Gaudio beat Justin Gimelstob 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 6-3. Seeds Dominik Hrbaty, Ivan Ljubicic and Mario Ancic made comfortable progress, but former French Open champion Albert Costa lost to Bjorn Phau.\\nHewitt overcomes wobble in Sydney\\n\\nLleyton Hewitt gave himself the perfect preparation for next week\\'s Australian Open with victory over Ivo Minar in the final of the Sydney International.\\n\\nThe defending champion brushed aside the Czech qualifier 7-5 6-0. The Australian world number three strolled to the first five games of the match but was shocked as Minar won the next five. The top seed was rattled but recovered to close out the set and raced to victory in exactly an hour. \"It was a strange match . . . momentum swings,\" said Hewitt. \"I felt like I came out of the blocks extremely well, but then he loosened up a bit. \"When he got back to 5-5, I had to try to settle down and take it up a notch, and I was able to do that.\"\\n\\nHewitt has now lifted the Sydney title four times in the last six years. \"It just keeps getting better and better every year,\" Hewitt said. \"I\\'ve only played this tournament four times and I\\'ve won it four times.\" Hewitt went into the final as a short-priced favourite to clinch his 24th career title after dropping only one set all week. He is set to meet Frenchman Arnaud Clement in the first round of the Australian Open. Minar, ranked 158th in the world, was forced to pull out of the Australian Open qualifying draw to play in his first ATP final. \"For me, this was a big success,\" said the 20-year-old. \"I was so nervous last night I couldn\\'t sleep. I\\'ve never played a top-10 player before. \"I wanted to play qualifying in Melbourne, but it\\'s Saturday and I\\'m still here. But this is a main draw and I need the points and the money.\" Alicia Molik takes on Samantha Stosur in an all-Australian women\\'s final later on Saturday.\\nParmar ruled out of Davis Cup tie\\n\\nA knee injury has forced Arvind Parmar out of Great Britain\\'s Davis Cup tie in Israel and left Alex Bogdanovic in line to take the second singles place.\\n\\nParmar picked up the injury last week and has failed to recover in time for the Europe/Africa Zone I tie, which begins in Tel Aviv on Friday. Bogdanovic looks set to take the second singles place alongside Greg Rusedski. GB captain Jeremy Bates could use 17-year-old Andrew Murray and David Sherwood in the doubles rubber. Bogdanovic and Murray both pulled out of tournaments last week through injury but are expected to be fit. Jamie Delgado and Lee Childs have been called into the squad in Tel Aviv as designated hitters for team practice but Bates has no plans to call either of them into his squad at present.\\n\\nThe unheralded Sherwood was the surprise inclusion when the squad was announced last week, and Bates said: \"David has earned his place in this squad on the merit of his form and results over the last 12 months.\" The 6ft 4in Sherwood is ranked 264th in the world and the LTA have high hopes for him after Futures tournament wins in Wrexham and Edinburgh.\\n\\nThe Sheffield-born right-hander, aged 24, also reached another final in Plaisir, France, a week after making the semi-final in Mulhouse. Bates is glad to have Rusedski available after Tim Henman\\'s retirement from Davis Cup tennis. \"His wealth of experience is invaluable, particularly to the younger players and I know he will lead by example,\" Bates said. \"We are looking forward to the tie. The squad are all in excellent form.\"\\nFederer forced to dig deep\\n\\nTop seed Roger Federer had to save two match points before squeezing past Juan Carlos Ferrero at the Dubai Open.\\n\\nThe world number one took two hours 15 minutes to earn his 4-6 6-3 7-6 victory, saving match points at 6-4 in the tiebreak before claiming it 8-6. Federer made a number of unforced errors early on, allowing Ferrero to take advantage and claim the first set. But the Swiss star hit back to reach the quarter-finals, where he will face seventh seed Russian Mikhail Youzhny. The Russian beat Germany\\'s Rainer Schuettler 7-5 6-4. Federer was not unduly worried despite being taken to three sets for the third consecutive match. The world number one was forced to go the distance against Ivan Ljubicic in the Rotterdam final and against Ivo Minar in the first round in Dubai. \"I definitely had a slow start again and to come back every time is quite an effort,\" he said. \"I haven\\'t been playing well, but I\\'ve been coming through. I\\'m winning the crucial points and that shows I\\'m on top of my game when I have to be.\"\\nCapriati to miss Melbourne\\n\\nJennifer Capriati has become the third leading lady to withdraw from the Australian Open because of injury.\\n\\nThe organisers of the first grand slam of 2005, which begins on 17 January, said the American has a problem with her right shoulder. It comes as a blow to the women\\'s draw as last year\\'s champion, Justin Henin-Hardenne, and runner-up, Kim Clijsters, will also be absent. Capriati is a two-time champion in Melbourne with wins in 2001 and 2002. She is believed to have picked up the injury at the Advanta Championships at Philadelphia in November and had to pull out of an exhibition match with Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova on 17 December. Capriati also decided against competing in the Australian Open warm-up event, the Sydney International.\\nHewitt falls to Dent\\n\\nLleyton Hewitt suffered a shock defeat to Taylor Dent in the quarter-finals of the Australian Hardcourt Championships in Adelaide on Friday.\\n\\nThe top seed was a strong favourite for the title but went down 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 to the American. Dent will face Juan Ignacio Chela next after the fourth seed was too strong for Jurgen Melzer. Olivier Rochus beat third seed Nicolas Kiefer 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (8-6) 7-5 and will take on second seed Joachim Johansson. The Swede reached the last four by beating compatriot Thomas Enqvist 6-3 4-6 6-1. \"I felt like I was striking the ball much better,\" said Johansson. \"I felt like I had a lot of break chances, I didn\\'t take care of them all, but I broke him four times and he only broke me once. \"I felt that was the key to get up in the set early.\"\\nAngry Williams rejects criticism\\n\\nSerena Williams has angrily rejected claims that she and sister Venus are a declining force in tennis.\\n\\nThe sisters ended last year without a Grand Slam title for the first time since 1998. But Serena denied their challenge was fading, saying: \"That\\'s not fair - I\\'m tired of not saying anything. \"We\\'ve been practising hard. We\\'ve had serious injuries. I\\'ve had surgery and after, I got to the Wimbledon final. I don\\'t know many who have done that.\" While Serena is through to the Australian Open semi-finals, Venus went out in the fourth round, meaning she has not gone further than the last eight in her last five Grand Slam appearances. But Serena added: \"Venus had a severe strain in her stomach. I actually had the same injury, but I didn\\'t tear it the way she did.\\n\\n\"If I would have torn it, I wouldn\\'t have been here. \"She played a player (Alicia Molik) that just played out of her mind and Venus made some errors that she probably shouldn\\'t have made.\" Serena also said people tended to forget the impact the 2003 murder of sister Yetunde Price had had on the family. \"To top it off, we have a very, very, very, very, very close family\" Serena continued. \"To be in some situation that we\\'ve been placed in in the past little over a year, it\\'s not easy to come out and just perform at your best when you realize there are so many things that are so important. \"So, no, we\\'re not declining. We\\'re here. I don\\'t have to win this tournament to prove anything. I know that I\\'m out here and I know that I\\'m one of the best players out here.\"\\nSafin relieved at Aussie recovery\\n\\nMarat Safin admitted he thought he was suffering another Australian Open final nightmare when he lost the opening set to Lleyton Hewitt.\\n\\nThe Russian, who lost the 2002 and 2004 finals, fought back brilliantly to win 1-6 6-3 6-4 6-4. \"I was nervous and I couldn\\'t play tennis,\" said Safin. \"He started really well. He wasn\\'t as nervous as I was because I was thinking of the two finals that I played and wasn\\'t successful.\" He added: \"You really have to deal with the pressure because normally it never happens but when you come to the final you are so tight because you want to win. \"I tried to play some tennis but I couldn\\'t. He has huge experience, he\\'s won two Grand Slam titles, he\\'s won 24 titles, he\\'s a great player and he deals with pressure.\"\\n\\nFrom 4-1 down in the third set, Safin played some of his best tennis to reel off seven games and take control of the match. \"In the third set, just all of a sudden, it all turn around completely in a way I couldn\\'t expect,\" said Safin. \"Because he made a couple of mistakes, I was a little bit lucky at some point, then the confidence came back and I was back in the game.\" And the Russian revealed that the victory, and his semi-final win over world number one Roger Federer, had given him a massive boost for the future. \"You get huge confidence because Roger is a great player,\" said Safin. \"Once I beat him, and then Lleyton, it\\'s like you get so much confidence in yourself that you really can play great. \"You can win big titles and you can beat huge players in the finals and semi-finals.\"\\nNadal puts Spain 2-0 up\\n\\nResult: Nadal 6-7 (6/8) 6-2 7-6 (8/6) 6-2 Roddick\\n\\nSpain\\'s Rafael Nadal beats Andy Roddick of the USA in the second singles match rubber of the 2004 Davis Cup final in Seville. Spain lead 1-0 after Carlos Moya beat Mardy Fish in straight sets in the opening match of the tie.\\n\\nNadal holds his nerve and the crowd goes wild as Spain go 2-0 up in the tie.\\n\\nRoddick holds serve to force Nadal to serve for the match but the American surely cannot turn things around now.\\n\\nNadal works Roddick around the court on two consecutive points to earn two break points. One is enough, the Spaniard secures the double-break and Roddick is now teetering on the edge.\\n\\nRoddick is trying to gee himself up but the clay surface is taking its toll on his game and he is looking tired. Nadal wins the game to love.\\n\\nNadal steps up the pressure to break and Spain have the early initiative in the fourth set.\\n\\nNadal also holds convincingly as both players feel their way into the fourth set.\\n\\nRoddick shrugs off the disappointment of losing the third-set tiebreak and breezes through his first service game of the fourth set.\\n\\nNadal earns the first mini-break in the tiebreak as the match enters its fourth hour. A couple of stunning points follow, one where Nadal chases down a Roddick shot and turns into a passing winner. Then Roddick produces some amazing defence at the net to take the score to 4-4. Roddick has two serves for the set but double-faults to take the score to 5-5. Nadal saves a Roddick set point then earns his own with a drive volley - and a crosscourt passing winner sends the crowd wild.\\n\\nNadal tries to up his aggression and he passes Roddick down the line to go 15-40 and two set points up. Roddick saves the first with a desperate lunge volley and smacks a volley winner across the court to take the score back to deuce before securing the game. The set will go to another tiebreak.\\n\\nNadal enjoys another straightforward hold and Roddick must once again serve to stay in the set.\\n\\nRoddick again holds on, despite some brilliant shot-making from his opponent.\\n\\nNadal races through his service game to put the pressure straight back onto Roddick.\\n\\nRoddick hangs in on his serve to level matters but Nadal is making him fight for every point.\\n\\nNadal could be suffering a disappointment hangover from the previous game as he goes 0-30 down and then has to save a break point after a tremendous rally in which he is forced into some brilliant defence. But it pays off and the Spaniard edges ahead in the set.\\n\\nRoddick\\'s serve is not firing as ferociously as usual and has to rely on his sheer competitive determination to stay in the set. Three times, Nadal forces a break point and three times the world number two hangs in. And Roddick\\'s grit pays off as he manages to hold.\\n\\nRoddick still looks a bit sluggish but he attacks the net and is rewarded with a break point, which Nadal saves with a good first serve and the Spaniard goes on to hold.\\n\\nThere is a disruption in play as Roddick is upset about something in the crowd. The Spanish captain gets involved as does the match referee but it is unclear what the problem is. One thing for certain is that the crowd are roused into support of Nadal and they go wild when Roddick loses the next point and goes break point down. Roddick saves the break point and then bangs down his ninth ace before clinching the game with a service winner.\\n\\nThe game passes the two-hour mark as Nadal holds serve to edge ahead in the third set.\\n\\nNow Roddick has to defend a break point and he produces a characteristic ace to save it. It is immediately followed by another and he holds with a little dinked half-volley winner.\\n\\nRoddick is looking a little leaden-footed but does carve out a break point for himself. But he plays it poorly and Nadal avoids the danger.\\n\\nRoddick has gone off the boil and again struggles. He fails to get down properly for a low forehand volley and gives Nadal three break points. The American blasts an ace to save one but follows up with a double fault and the rubber is level.\\n\\nNadal edges towards taking the second set with a comfortable hold.\\n\\nTwo good serves put Roddick 30-0 up but he then makes a couple of errors to find himself 30-40 down. He saves the break point with an ace and then manages to hold.\\n\\nRoddick\\'s level has dropped while Nadal is on a hot streak. The Spaniard includes a superb crosscourt winner off the back foot as he races through his service game without dropping a point.\\n\\nRoddick double-faults twice and Nadal takes full advantage of the break point offered, powering a passing winner past Roddick.\\n\\nNadal wins another tight game. Neither player has dipped from the high standard of play in the first set.\\n\\nNadal puts the American under pressure and Roddick saves a break point with a superb stop volley before going on to hold.\\n\\nNadal puts the disappointment of losing the first-set tiebreak to claim the opening game in the second.\\n\\nRoddick double-faults to concede the first mini-break and then Nadal loops a crosscourt winner to seize advantage in the tiebreak. He lets one slip but wins his next serve to earn three set points. But Roddick saves them and then earns one himself. Nadal comes up with a down-the-line winner but then nets tamely on Roddick\\'s next set point.\\n\\nNadal\\'s nerve is tested as he tries to force a tiebreak. Both players come up with some scintillating tennis and the Spaniard has several chances to clinch the game before finally doing so when Roddick drives wide.\\n\\nA pulsating game sees Nadal racing round the court retrieving and refusing to give Roddick any easy points. The point of the match so far involves Roddick\\'s slam-dunk smash being returned by Nadal before Roddick finally manages to end the rally. On the very next point, Nadal blasts a forehand service return from right of court that passes Roddick and even the American is forced to applaud. But Roddick comes up with two big serves to polish off the game.\\n\\nNadal outplays Roddick to reach 40-0 but the American fights back to 40-30 before Nadal\\'s powerful crosscourt forehand winner secures the game.\\n\\nThe crowd are getting very involved, cheering between Roddick\\'s first and second serves. But the American comes through to hold and edge ahead in the set.\\n\\nNadal manages to hold again despite Roddick piling the pressure on his serve. The Spaniard wins the game courtesy of another lucky net cord.\\n\\nRoddick double faults buts manages to keep his composure. A well-placed serve is unreturnable and Roddick holds.\\n\\nA powerful ace down the middle gives Nadal a simple love service game - the first time he has held serve so far in the match. If Roddick didn\\'t know before, he knows now that he is in a real contest.\\n\\nAnother superb game as Nadal breaks to once again lift the roof. He produces some fine groundstrokes to leave Roddick chasing shadows. Four of the first five games have seen a break of serve.\\n\\nDespite the disappointment of losing his serve, Roddick is not phased and storms into a 40-15 lead when the umpire leaves his seat to confirm a close line-call. Nadal takes the next point but Roddick breaks again with a sharp volley at the net.\\n\\nRoddick\\'s advantage is short lived as Nadal breaks back immediately. A fortunate net cord helps the Spaniard on his way and when Roddick fires a forehand cross court shot wide to lose his serve, Nadal pumps his fist in celebration.\\n\\nThe American is pumped up for this clash and takes on Nadal\\'s serve from the start. Nadal\\'s drop shot is agonisingly called out and Roddick claims the vital first break.\\n\\nAfter Moya\\'s win in the opening rubber, a raucous Seville crowd is buoyed by Nadal\\'s impressive start which sees him race into a 30-0 lead. However Roddick fights back to hold his serve.\\nDavenport dismantles young rival\\n\\nTop seed Lindsay Davenport booked her place in the last 16 of the Australian Open with a convincing 6-2 6-4 win over Nicole Vaidisova of the Czech Republic.\\n\\nThe American had too much power for her 15-year-old opponent, breaking twice in the first set and once in the second. The German-born Vaidisova rallied well at times but was unable to find a way back after falling behind 3-2 in the opening set. Davenport, who closed out with an ace, plays Karolina Sprem in the next round. \"I was fully expecting a tough opponent and was able to play well enough to get through it,\" said Davenport. \"I think she hits some great shots. She made some errors but probably some inexperience played a role in that. But she\\'s so young and obviously has a big game and has many, many years to improve on that.\" Sprem, the Croatian 13th seed, saw off Russia\\'s Elena Likhovtseva 6-3 6-2. Former world number one\\n\\npowered her way into the fourth round with a straight sets win over Anna Smashnova. The 27th seed from Israel stuck with Williams until 3-3 in the first set before it became one-way traffic.\\n\\nThe American made 26 unforced errors but was still good enough to romp through the contest in exactly an hour. She reeled off nine straight games to finish a 6-3 6-0 winner.\\n\\nremains on course to become the first Australian to win her home title since Chris O\\'Neil in 1978. The 10th seed equalled her best performance at a Grand Slam event when she beat unseeded Russian Nadia Petrova 6-3 6-2 to reach the fourth round. After a tough first set, Molik grew in confidence and won in just 56 minutes. She will now meet Venus Williams. \"Bring it on,\" said the 23-year-old. \"I played pretty well and it was nice to get through in straight sets.\" \"We were destined to meet, I guess,\" Williams said referring to her match with Molik. \"It will be a huge match for her in Australia. I can tell she\\'s probably very motivated by that so I need to get out there and play well.\"\\n\\nbeat Slovakia\\'s Daniela Hantuchova in a rollercoaster match. Dementieva came through 7-5 5-7 6-4, becoming the seventh Russian woman to reach the last 16 in Melbourne. The match lasted almost three hours and featured 13 service breaks, including three in the final set when Dementieva held her nerve to seal the win. She now faces\\n\\nafter the Swiss 12th seed beat American Abigail Spears 7-6 6-3. French Open champion\\n\\nreceived a free ride into the last 16 after Lisa Raymond was forced to withdraw. Raymond, the 25th seeded American, was ruled out after sustaining a left abdominal muscle tear in the doubles. Myskina, the third seed, now plays France\\'s\\n\\nwho beat Francesca Schiavone of Italy 6-3 6-3. \"I\\'m extremely disappointed because I couldn\\'t have asked to play better in my first two matches,\" Raymond said.\\nBig guns ease through in San Jose\\n\\nTop-seeded Americans Andy Roddick and Andre Agassi survived minor scares to reach the last eight of the SAP Open.\\n\\nAgassi endured early problems against left-handed Dane Kenneth Carlsen before sealing a 7-5 6-1 victory. And world number three Roddick dropped a set to Korean player Hyung-Taik Lee, before pulling out a 6-3 3-6 6-2 win in San Jose, California. Seventh seed Jurgen Melzer came through 6-3 6-3 against Xavier Malisse - winner in Delray Beach last week. Frenchman Cyril Saulnier, meanwhile, fired 19 aces to secure a 6-1 7-6 win over Czech qualifier Tomas Zib.\\n\\nRoddick broke a racket in frustration in the third game of the second set. and afterwards was unimpressed with his form. \"I\\'m not playing great,\" he said. \"But I\\'m through and I\\'m going to keep battling. \"A lot of people are under the assumption that it\\'s easy to play well every week and it\\'s not.\" It is the 12th time in 13 appearances at the event that Agassi, now 34, has progressed to the quarter-final stage. He came from 0-40 down in the opening game to hold serve and gradually wore Carlsen down after attacking his backhand. Agassi also employed several lobs and charged to the net to unsettle the 31-year-old Dane, ranked 88th in the world. \"As the match went on, I got real patient and waited for my opportunities and felt pretty good,\" said Agassi.\\nRusedski angry over supplements\\n\\nGreg Rusedski has criticised the governing body of men\\'s tennis for not releasing contamination-free supplements in time for the new season.\\n\\nRusedski said: \"I tried to order some but didn\\'t receive any and I haven\\'t got any yet. \"You would think they would have been available in December as it can take two months for the body to respond. \"This event comes in the hottest period of the year, so you would hope the stuff would be available for it.\" The British number two escaped a possible ban last year when he persuaded a tribunal that a positive doping test was the result of contaminated ATP supplements. In response, the ATP struck a deal with pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline to provide contamination-free drinks and nutritional bars for the men\\'s tour.\\n\\nDavid Higdon, Vice President of the ATP, admitted: \"I agree with Greg. \"I would have loved to have had these things available as soon as possible but it\\'s a lot of work to make sure they have gone through rigorous testing. \"The reality is though that the first two weeks of the tour are spread far and wide and part of the distribution agreement we had with GSK has an education component. \"We weren\\'t going to just drop these products out there without having a talk with the players about understanding how to use them.\\n\\n\"The first chance we will get to do that is at the players meeting on the Saturday before the Australian Open.\" And Rusedski, who takes on Roger Federer at the Qatar Open later on Wednesday, conceded that the imminent changes will be beneficial. \"The good thing is that there is now a 100% guarantee, so hopefully all this will never happen again,\" said Rusedski. \"Hopefully after the Australian Open we won\\'t have to discuss this any more.\"\\nRoddick in talks over new coach\\n\\nAndy Roddick is reportedly close to confirming US Davis Cup assistant Dean Goldfine as his new coach.\\n\\nRoddick ended his 18-month partnership with Brad Gilbert on Monday, and Goldfine admits talks have taken place. \"We had a really good conversation and we\\'re on the same page in terms of what I expect from a player in commitment and what he wants,\" said Goldfine. \"The reading I got from him is that I would have a lot of the qualities he\\'s looking for in a coach.\" Speaking to told South Florida\\'s Sun-Sentinel newspaper, Goldfine added: \"That being said, from his standpoint, which is smart, he wants to cover all his bases. \"I think Andy wants a long-term relationship and wants to make sure it\\'s the right fit... the best fit.\" Goldfine, 39, has worked with Todd Martin and Roddick\\'s close friend Mardy Fish, and was an assistant coach with the US Olympic team. Martin is the other name to have been linked to the vacant post alongside Roddick.\\nVeteran Martinez wins Thai title\\n\\nConchita Martinez won her first title in almost five years with victory over Anna-Lena Groenefeld at the Volvo Women\\'s Open in Pattaya, Thailand.\\n\\nThe 32-year-old Spaniard came through 6-3 3-6 6-3 for her first title since Berlin in 2000. \"It feels really good,\" said Martinez, who is playing her last season on the Tour. \"To come through like that in an important match feels good. \"It\\'s been nearly five years and I didn\\'t think I could do it.\" Groenefeld was the more powerful player but could not match her opponent\\'s relentless accuracy. \"It was my first final, a new experience,\" said the German. \"I think she played a good match, a tough match, but I tried to stay in there. I think the whole week was good for me.\"\\nYoung debut cut short by Ginepri\\n\\nFifteen-year-old Donald Young\\'s first appearance in an ATP tennis tournament proved brief as the teenager went out in round one of the San Jose Open.\\n\\nYoung shot to the top of the junior world rankings when he won the boys\\' singles at January\\'s Australian Open. But the wildcard entry was dispatched by fellow American Robby Ginepri in straight sets, 6-2 6-2, in California. Despite that he was happy with his Tour debut. \"It was fun. I had my chances, but they didn\\'t come through,\" he said. Young, who beat two players ranked in the top 200 when he was just 14, was only 2-1 down in the first set before losing 10 of the next 13 games. And Ginepri - six years older than the youngest player to ever win a junior slam and top the global standings - admitted he was impressed.\\n\\n\"He\\'s very talented,\" said Ginepri. \"He\\'s got a long future ahead of him. \"Being left-handed, he was very quick around the court. \"His serve is a little deceptive. He came into the net and volleyed better than I thought.\" Earlier, South Korean Hyung-Taik Lee defeated American Jan-Michael Gambill 6-3 7-6 (7-4). American Kevin Kim defeated Jan Hernych of the Czech Republic 7-5 6-3, Canadian qualifier Frank Dancevic downed American Jeff Morrison 4-6 7-6 (7-3) 6-0, and Denmark\\'s Kenneth Carlsen beat Irakli Labadze of the Republic of Georgia 6-7 (4-7) 6-2 6-3. Top seed Andy Roddick launches his defence of the title on Wednesday against qualifier Paul Goldstein. Second seed Andre Agassi opens his campaign on Tuesday against wildcard Bobby Reynolds, last year\\'s US collegiate champion. Agassi has won the San Jose five times, but his run of three straight titles ended last year when he fell to Mardy Fish in the semi-finals. Fish went on to lose to Roddick in the final.\\nRoddick splits from coach Gilbert\\n\\nAndy Roddick has ended an 18-month association with coach Brad Gilbert which yielded the US Open title and saw the American become world number one.\\n\\nRoddick released a statement through the SFX Sports Group with the news but did not give a reason for the split. \"The decision to not re-hire Brad Gilbert for the 2005 season is based on what I think is best for my game at this time,\" said Roddick. \"Any more on this situation\\'s a private matter between coach and player.\" Roddick won 121 of his 147 matches while working with Gilbert, and said he had enjoyed their time together. He won his first Grand Slam event at Flushing Meadows last year, and finished 2003 on top of the ATP Tour rankings.\\n\\nBut Roddick slipped to second this year behind Roger Federer, who became the first man since 1988 to win three Majors in a season. Federer, who has not had a coach since he split from Peter Lundgren at the end of last year, beat Roddick to win the Wimbledon title and in two other tournament finals. Roddick hired Gilbert after deciding to part from coach Tarik Benhabiles in the wake of his first-round exit at the 2003 French Open. He went on to win the US Open and four other titles for the year. He has won four events this season. \"I have enjoyed all of my time with Andy,\" Gilbert said on his personal website. \"He has been a great student of the game during the time that we worked together and I am very proud of the results that were achieved. \"While I believe that there is still a great deal of work to be done, Andy clearly does not feel that way.\"\\nHenman to face Saulnier test\\n\\nBritish number one Tim Henman will face France\\'s Cyril Saulnier in the first round of next week\\'s Australian Open.\\n\\nGreg Rusedski, the British number two, is in the same quarter of the draw and could face Andy Roddick in the second round if he beats Swede Jonas Bjorkman. Local favourite Lleyton Hewitt will meet France\\'s Arnaud Clement, while defending champion and world number one Roger Federer faces Fabrice Santoro. Women\\'s top seed Lindsay Davenport drew Spanish veteran Conchita Martinez.\\n\\nHenman came from two sets down to defeat Saulnier in the first round of the French Open last year, so he knows he faces a tough test in Melbourne. The seventh seed, who has never gone beyond the quarter-finals in the year\\'s first major and is lined up to meet Roddick in the last eight, is looking forward to the match. \"He\\'s tough player on any surface, he\\'s got a lot of ability,\" he said. \"We had a really tight one in Paris that went my way so I\\'m going to need to play well from the outset because he\\'s a dangerous competitor.\" Switzerland\\'s Federer, seeded one, is the hot favourite having won three of the four grand slam titles in 2004. He has beaten Santoro in five of their seven previous encounters, but is taking nothing for granted. \"It\\'s a tricky match,\" Federer said. \"I played him at the US Open and won quite comfortably then. But you never know, if the rhythm is a bit off, he can keep you guessing and make it difficult. \"The most important thing, though, is to get used to playing five-set matches and winning them.\" The 23-year-old could meet four-time champion Andre Agassi in the quarter-finals before meeting Russian Marat Safin, the player he beat in last year\\'s final.\\n\\nEighth-seeded American Agassi is set to play a qualifier in round one if he can shake off a hip injury which ruled him out of the Kooyong Classic. Second seed Andy Roddick will open his campaign against Irakli Labadze of Georgia. The American could meet Rusedski in the second round, seventh seed Henman in the quarter-finals and Hewitt in the last four. Hewitt is hoping to become the first Australian man to win the event since Mark Edmondson in 1976. The 23-year-old has never been beyond round four in eight attempts at Melbourne Park but has at least secured the opposite half of the draw to Federer, who beat him in the Australian Open, Wimbledon and US Open last year. Safin, seeded four, opens his campaign against a qualifier with 16th seed Tommy Haas, the player he beat in the semi-finals in 2002, a possible fourth-round opponent.\\n\\nIn the women\\'s draw, Davenport could encounter eighth-seeded Venus Williams in the quarter-finals and third-ranked Anastasia Myskina, the French Open champion, in the semi-finals. Bronchitis ruled Davenport, the 2000 Australian Open champion, out of her Sydney quarter-final on Thursday. Venus Williams, who lost to younger sister Serena in the Melbourne final two years ago, opens against Eleni Daniilidou of Greece. Serena Williams, who won her fourth consecutive grand slam at the 2003 Australian Open, was drawn in the bottom quarter with second seed Amelie Mauresmo, a runner-up in 1999. Serena will open against another Frenchwoman Camille Pin, while Mauresmo plays Australia\\'s Samantha Stosur. Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova, seeded fourth, drew a qualifier in the first round but could meet fellow Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova, the US Open winner, in the last eight\\n\\n1 Roger Federer (Switzerland)\\n\\n2 Andy Roddick (US)\\n\\n3 Lleyton Hewitt (Australia)\\n\\n4 Marat Safin (Russia)\\n\\n5 Carlos Moya (Spain)\\n\\n6 Guillermo Coria (Argentina)\\n\\n7 Tim Henman (Britain)\\n\\n8 Andre Agassi (US)\\n\\n9 David Nalbandian (Argentina)\\n\\n10 Gaston Gaudio (Argentina)\\n\\n11 Joachim Johansson (Sweden)\\n\\n12 Guillermo Canas (Argentina)\\n\\n13 Tommy Robredo (Spain)\\n\\n14 Sebastien Grosjean (France)\\n\\n15 Mikhail Youzhny (Russia)\\n\\n16 Tommy Haas (Germany)\\n\\n17 Andrei Pavel (Romania)\\n\\n18 Nicolas Massu (Chile)\\n\\n19 Vincent Spadea (US)\\n\\n20 Dominik Hrbaty (Slovakia)\\n\\n21 Nicolas Kiefer (Germany)\\n\\n22 Ivan Ljubicic (Croatia)\\n\\n23 Fernando Gonzalez (Chile)\\n\\n24 Feliciano Lopez (Spain)\\n\\n25 Juan Ignacio Chela (Argentina)\\n\\n26 Nikolay Davydenko (Russia)\\n\\n27 Paradorn Srichaphan (Thailand)\\n\\n28 Mario Ancic (Croatia)\\n\\n29 Taylor Dent (US)\\n\\n30 Thomas Johansson (Sweden)\\n\\n31 Juan Carlos Ferrero (Spain)\\n\\n32 Jurgen Melzer (Austria)\\n\\n1 Lindsay Davenport (US)\\n\\n2 Amelie Mauresmo (France)\\n\\n3 Anastasia Myskina (Russia)\\n\\n4 Maria Sharapova (Russia)\\n\\n5 Svetlana Kuznetsova (Russia)\\n\\n6 Elena Dementieva (Russia)\\n\\n7 Serena Williams (US)\\n\\n8 Venus Williams (US)\\n\\n9 Vera Zvonareva (Russia)\\n\\n10 Alicia Molik (Australia)\\n\\n11 Nadia Petrova (Russia)\\n\\n12 Patty Schnyder (Switzerland)\\n\\n13 Karolina Sprem (Croatia)\\n\\n14 Francesca Schiavone (Italy)\\n\\n15 Silvia Farina Elia (Italy)\\n\\n16 Ai Sugiyama (Japan)\\n\\n17 Fabiola Zuluaga (Colombia)\\n\\n18 Elena Likhovtseva (Russia)\\n\\n19 Nathalie Dechy (France)\\n\\n20 Tatiana Golovin (France)\\n\\n21 Amy Frazier (US)\\n\\n22 Magdalena Maleeva (Bulgaria)\\n\\n23 Jelena Jankovic (Serbia and Montenegro)\\n\\n24 Mary Pierce (France)\\n\\n25 Lisa Raymond (US)\\n\\n26 Daniela Hantuchova (Slovakia)\\n\\n27 Anna Smashnova (Israel)\\n\\n28 Shinobu Asagoe (Japan)\\n\\n29 Gisela Dulko (Argentina)\\n\\n30 Flavia Pennetta (Italy)\\n\\n31 Jelena Kostanic (Croatia)\\n\\n32 Iveta Benesova (Czech Republic)\\nMinister digs in over doping row\\n\\nThe Belgian sports minister at the centre of the Svetlana Kuznetsova doping row says he will not apologise for making allegations against her.\\n\\nClaude Eerdekens claims the US Open champion tested positive for ephedrine at an exhibition event last month. Criticised for making the announcement, he said: \"I will never apologise. This product is banned and it\\'s up to her to explain why it\\'s there.\" Kuznetsova says the stimulant may have been in a cold remedy she took. The Russian said she did nothing wrong by taking the medicine during the event. The Women\\'s Tennis Association cleared Kuznetsova of any offence because the drug is not banned when taken out of competition.\\n\\nEerdekens said he made the statement in order to protect the other three players that took part in the tournament, Belgian Justine Henin-Hardenne, Nathalie Dechy of France and Russia\\'s Elena Dementieva. But Dechy is fuming that she has been implicated in the row. \"How can you be happy when you see your face on the cover page and talking about doping?\" Dechy said. \"I\\'m really upset about it and I think the Belgian government did a really bad job about this. \"I think we deserve an apology from the guy. You cannot say anything like this - you cannot say some stuff like this, saying it\\'s one of these girls. This is terrible.\" Dementieva is also angry and says that Dechy and herself are the real victims of the scandal. \"You have no idea what I have been through all these days. It\\'s been too hard on me,\" she said. \"The WTA are trying to handle this problem by saying there are three victims, but I see only two victims in this story - me and Nathalie Dechy, who really have nothing to do with this. \"To be honest with you, I don\\'t feel like I want to talk to Sveta at all. I\\'m just very upset with the way everything has happened.\"\\nSerena ends Sania Mirza\\'s dream\\n\\nSania Mirza, the first Indian woman to reach the third round of a Grand Slam tennis event, has lost to women\\'s favourite Serena Williams.\\n\\nThe 18-year-old Mirza, who got a wild card entry into the Australian Open in Melbourne, lost to Williams 1-6,4-6 in the third round. Williams took just 56 minutes to defeat Mirza and sail into the fourth round. The only other Indian woman to win a match at a Grand Slam is Nirupama Vaidyanathan. Vaidyanathan made it to the second round of the Australian Open in 1998.\\n\\nPlaying the biggest match of her life, Mirza made little impact on Williams in the early stages of the game. But the teenager showed more confidence in the second set and engaged the seventh-seeded Williams in some well contested rallies. Mirza, a junior Wimbledon doubles title winner, became the first Indian woman to reach the third round of a grand slam tennis event when she beat Hungarian Petra Mandula on Wednesday. \"I\\'m really excited. I was confident but I didn\\'t think it was going to be that easy,\" Mirza said after her second round win. \"My aim was to win a round here. When I did that I was so relieved, there was no pressure.\" Tennis is not a particularly popular sport in India, but a number of Indians watched the live telecast of the match between Mirza and Williams. Mirza, who lives in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad known for producing a host of top Indian cricketers, turned professional two years ago. She says she was considered too small when she went for her first tennis classes as a six-year-old girl. \"Then finally [the coach] called my parents up and said \\'the way she hits the ball, I\\'ve never seen a six-year-old hit a ball like that\\',\" Mirza told the Associated Press.\\nHantuchova in Dubai last eight\\n\\nDaniela Hantuchova moved into the quarter-finals of the Dubai Open, after beating Elene Likhotseva of Russia 7-5 6-4, and now faces Serena Williams.\\n\\nAustralian Open champion Williams survived an early scare to beat Russia\\'s Elena Bovina 1-6 6-1 6-4. World number one Lindsay Davenport and Anastasia Myskina also progressed. Davenport defeated China\\'s Jie Zheng 6-2 7-5, while French Open champion Myskina sailed through after her opponent Marion Bartoli retired hurt. American Davenport will now face fellow former Wimbledon champion, Conchita Martinez of Spain, who ousted seventh-seeded Nathalie Dechy of France 6-1 6-2. Myskina will face eighth-seed Patty Schnyder from Switzerland, who defeated China\\'s Li Na 6-3 7-6 (10-8). The other quarter final pits wild card Sania Mirza of India against Jelena Jankovic of Serbia and Montenegro, who both won on Tuesday.\\n\\nBefore her meeting with Martinez, Davenport believes there is some room for improvement in her game. \"I started well and finished well, but played some so-so games in the middle,\" she said. Williams was also far from content. \"I don\\'t know what I was doing there,\" she said. \"It was really windy and I hadn\\'t played in the wind. All my shots were going out of here.\" But Hantuchova is in upbeat mood ahead of her clash with the younger Williams sister, who was handed a first-round bye. \"I feel I have an advantage (over Serena) because I have already played two matches on these courts,\" she said. \"It is a difficult court to play on. Very fast and sometimes you feel you have no control over the ball.\"\\nSlovakia seal Hopman Cup success\\n\\nSlovakia clinched the Hopman Cup for the second time by beating Argentina 3-0 in Saturday\\'s final in Perth.\\n\\nDaniela Hantuchova put the third seeds ahead, recovering from a terrible start to beat Gisela Dulko 1-6 6-4 6-4. Dominik Hrbaty, who had not lost a set in his three singles matches in the group stages, then upset world number seven Guillermo Coria 6-4 6-1. Hantuchova and Hrbaty then won the mixed doubles after Coria was forced to withdraw because of a sore back. Slovakia\\'s win made up for last year\\'s final defeat to the United States. \"I would like to congratulate Daniela,\" Hrbaty said. \"I was so nervous watching her today, I almost had a heart attack. \"I also feel a little sorry for Guillermo because I get very excited whenever I play for my country. I show lots of emotions and played such good tennis.\"\\n\\nWorld number 31 Hantuchova, ranked two places above Dulko, looked nervous as she dropped the first four games of the match. Dulko, who had lost all three of her singles matches in the group stages, grew in confidence and took the opening set in just 27 minutes. But Hantuchova hit back to take the next two and the match. \"I was so nervous because I really wanted to win for the team and for Dominik as he played so well all week,\" she said. \"I didn\\'t think I was playing my best but I just tried to hang in there and fight hard for every point for my country.\" Slovakia won the Cup on their first appearance in 1998 when Karol Kucera and Karina Habsudova beat France.\\nBryan twins keep US hopes alive\\n\\nThe United States kept the Davis Cup final alive with victory in Saturday\\'s doubles rubber, leaving Spain 2-1 ahead going into the final day.\\n\\nMasters Cup champions Mike and Bob Bryan thrashed Juan Carlos Ferrero and Tommy Robredo 6-0 6-3 6-2 in front of a partisan crowd in Seville. Victory would have given Spain the title but they were outclassed. In Sunday\\'s reverse singles, Carlos Moya takes on Andy Roddick before Rafael Nadal faces Mardy Fish. \"It feels good, but it\\'s not going to be as good if we don\\'t win two tomorrow,\" said Mike Bryan. \"It feels good to give those guys another shot, and Spain has to go to sleep on that.\" Bob Bryan added: \"I\\'m really confident in Andy winning that first match, and then anything can happen.\" Spain coach Jordi Arrese chose to rest 18-year-old Nadal in the doubles after his epic singles win over Roddick on Friday. He was replaced by former world number one Ferrero, but the Spanish pair were out of their depth against one of the world\\'s best doubles teams.\\n\\nThe 26-year-old Bryan twins have won all four of their Davis Cup matches this year. And they quickly silenced the huge crowd at the Olympic Stadium, racing through the opening set to love. The Spaniards then twice surrendered breaks of serve at the start of the second before the Bryans broke to go 5-3 ahead and served out. When Robredo dropped serve in the opening game of the third set the match was all but over, and the unflappable Bryan brothers powered on to an impressive win. Ferrero, who was upset to be dropped for Friday\\'s singles, hinted at further dissatisfaction after the defeat. \"It was a difficult game against the best doubles players,\" he said. \"They have everything calculated and we had very little to do. \"I was a bit surprised that I was named to play the doubles match because I hardly play doubles.\" Arrese said: \"Juan Carlos hasn\\'t played at all badly. He played the right way but the Bryans are great doubles players.\"\\nProdigy Monfils blows away Gaudio\\n\\nFrench prodigy Gael Monfils underlined his huge promise by beating French Open champion Gaston Gaudio 6-4 7-6 (7-4) in the first round of the Qatar Open.\\n\\nThe 18-year-old wild card won three of the four junior Grand Slam events last year, including Wimbledon. Fabrice Santoro, the 2000 champion, beat Sweden\\'s Thomas Johansson 6-4 6-2 but fourth seed Mikhail Youzhny lost 6-3 7-6 (7-3) to Rafael Nadal. Roger Federer plays Greg Rusedski in the second round on Wednesday. Monfils, who was given a wildcard into the tournament, said: \"This is my first win over a top 10 player and I am delighted. \"I play my best tennis when I am fired up on the court and the reason I won today was because I was able to play my natural, attacking game,\" he said. \"Of course I was a bit tired in the second set. But I was confident I could survive had there been a third set.\"\\nDavenport hits out at Wimbledon\\n\\nWorld number one Lindsay Davenport has criticised Wimbledon over the issue of equal prize money for women.\\n\\nReacting to a disputed comment by All England Club chairman Tim Phillips, the American said: \"I think it is highly insulting if prize money is taken away. \"Somebody, I think it was Mr Phillips, said they won\\'t have money for flowers at Wimbledon. That\\'s insulting.\" An All England club spokesperson denied Phillips made the remark, insisting: \"He definitely didn\\'t say it.\" The statement added: \"It was said by someone else and was a humorous aside at the end of a radio interview when the conversation had moved to talking about the Wimbledon grounds.\"\\n\\nDavenport was speaking following the announcement that this week\\'s Dubai Duty Free event will join the US and Australian Opens in offering equal prize money for women. \"You hear about women playing only three sets while men play five,\" said Daveport. \"And the best women are never going to beat the best men. \"But it\\'s a different game you go to watch with the women - it doesn\\'t make it better or worse. \"Hopefully we will be able to change people\\'s minds.\" Serena Williams, who is also in Dubai, added: \"I\\'m obviously for equal prize money. \"Women\\'s tennis is exciting. Men\\'s tennis is exciting as well, but the women have it right now. \"If you are bringing in the spectators you should be able to reap what everyone else is able to reap.\"\\nMoya clinches Cup for Spain\\n\\nSpain won the Davis Cup for the second time in their history when Carlos Moya beat the USA\\'s Andy Roddick in the fourth rubber in Seville.\\n\\nMoya won 6-2 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-5) to give the hosts an unassailable 3-1 lead with only one singles rubber remaining. Roddick battled hard and had chances in the second set, but Moya\\'s clay-court expertise proved the difference. Mardy Fish beat Tommy Robredo 7-6 (8-6) 6-2 in the final dead rubber to cut Spain\\'s winning margin to 3-2. Spain\\'s only other Davis Cup title came in 2000, when they beat Australia in Barcelona. This time they chose to play the final in Seville and the city\\'s Olympic Stadium was revamped to allow for a record crowd for a competitve tennis event of 27,000 spectators. And the home fans gave vociferous support to their players, with 18-year-old Nadal and Moya winning both Friday\\'s singles rubbers. American twins Mike and Bob Bryan gave the visitors hope with victory over Juan Carlos Ferrero and Tommy Robredo in Saturday\\'s doubles. But it remained an uphill task for a US team far happier on hard courts than clay, and 1998 French Open champion Moya had too much for world number two Roddick. \"This has been incredible - the moment I\\'ve been waiting for for years,\" said Moya, who missed out in 2000 through injury. \"I\\'ve prepared myself for this day. I knew that playing on clay I would have my chances to win.\\n\\n\"The Davis Cup is my dream. I can\\'t ask for more. There is nothing bigger than what I\\'ve lived today.\" Moya stormed into a 4-0 lead on his way to taking the first set against Roddick and recovered immediately from dropping serve in the second. The match came down to two tie-breaks and Moya dominated both, clinching victory on his third match point. Wild celebrations followed, with an emotional Moya congratulated by his team-mates, including Nadal, who at 18 years and 187 days becomes the youngest ever victor in Davis Cup history. \"I think we put up a better fight here than in Paris two years ago,\" said Roddick, who was on the US team which lost to France in the 2002 semi-finals at Roland Garros. \"They were just better than us this weekend. I have nothing to be ashamed of, I gave it my all. \"I am not going to walk out of here with my head down, that\\'s for sure. \"There\\'s no miracle answer. We have to improve.\"\\n'"

       " \"Boje missed the recent tour of India because of fears he would be called in for questioning by Indian police over match-fixing allegations. Pace bowler Dale Steyn and opening batsmen AB de Villiers are new faces in a 13-man squad. Despite suffering poor form in India, new wicket-keeper Thami Tsolekile has been preferred to Mark Boucher. There is no place for opener Herschelle Gibbs, who has been struggling with a finger injury after missing the India trip, and spin all-rounder Justin Ontong has been dropped. Nicky Boje, who underwent minor surgery to remove a growth in his neck, will have to pass a fitness test before the match. Port Elizabeth, where the first Test is being held, is South Africa's most spin-friendly venue.\",\n",

       " 'There had been concerns his rib muscle injury would restrict him to playing as a specialist batsman in the match. Captain Michael Vaughan said: \"He\\'s had a bowl and came out fine so he is fully fit to play as an all-rounder. \"We will see how he bowls. In Cape Town I thought he was our best bowler and in Durban probably our second best.\" Flintoff sent down around 20 deliveries at three-quarter pace during Wednesday\\'s practice session. The 27-year-old incurred a side strain during the 196-run defeat in Cape Townlast week and did not bowl again until the eve of the Johannesburg Test. Vaughan said he would not necessarily shield Flintoff from bowling the same heavy workload he endured in the first three Tests. The skipper commented: \"We will just have to judge who is bowling well on any given day and on the given surface to see how much we use him.',\n",
       " '\"But as a far as we\\'re concerned he is available to play any role required.\" Opening batsman Marcus Trescothick said the team remained confident despite the defeat in Cape Town which left the series evenly poised at 1-1 with two to play. He said: \"We\\'re allowed the odd blip here and there. You don\\'t win eight in a row without being something special. \"The guys are generally in good spirits, they needed the time off.\" With Flintoff happily fit to play and England thus likely to by unchanged, the form of pace spearhead Steve Harmison is the main concern. Trescothick said: \"Steve\\'s been fine throughout. [The ball\\'s] just not been coming out so well. \"Everyone goes through dips in form - it just depends how quickly people come back from those. But he\\'ll come back from that, we\\'re just waiting for it to happen.',\n",

       " 'But the board has resisted calls to cut the number of four-day games, with the County Championship format unchanged. From 2006, the 50-over C&G Trophy will be divided into two conferences with Scotland and Ireland added. It will be played in the first half of the season, with an August final, while the Totesport League will occupy the end of the summer, in a 40-over format.',\n",
       " 'However, the Scottish Saltires, who have finished bottom in two seasons in Division Two, will be removed from the competition after 2005. The nine teams in each Totesport League division will play each other just once - either home or away - with automatic two-up and two-down promotion and relegation spots. The third-placed team in Division Two will host the seventh-placed team in Division One in a one-off match to decide the final top-flight berth. An expansion of the Twenty20 Cup was already planned for 2005, and the ECB is to explore adding two further foreign teams in the future.',\n",
       " 'First Class Forum chairman Mike Soper headed the working party responsible for the changes, after initial suggestions by the ECB were rejected by county bosses. \"I am extremely pleased with the outcome of this report which was unanimously acclaimed at the recent FCF meeting,\" he said. \"We will now have a strong competition in the C&G Trophy which reflects international cricket. \"Our highly successful Twenty20 competition will have a 40-over competition immediately following it.\" Following a model set in Australia and South Africa, the England A team will face touring sides each summer, either playing two first-class matches or a combination of four- and one-day games.',\n",

       " 'Second Test, Durban, day three (close): England: 139 & 281-1 v South Africa 332',\n",
       " \"Both hit 132 - Strauss was unbeaten - as England finished day three 88 ahead on 281-1, having started it 163 behind. It was the 16th 200-run opening stand in England's history, and by the time Trescothick was bowled by Shaun Pollock it was the country's fifth best ever. Mark Butcher was Strauss's partner at stumps in Durban, unbeaten on one. Trescothick bludgeoned 20 fours and two sixes in his 261-ball innings, with Strauss hitting 16 boundaries from 272 balls faced. It was the duo's fourth stand of 150 or more and their best return in nine Tests together, bettering the 190 they shared against New Zealand at Lord's this summer. In what had been a low-scoring game, England started the day on 30-0 and seemingly with a mountain to climb. But, allied to some loose bowling, the vagaries of the pitch which had hindered them on day one had disappeared to make life easier for England.\",\n",
       " 'The first-wicket pair was circumspect in the opening 30 minutes of play, but soon feasted on the tripe served up by Dale Steyn, whose three-over spell cost 31 runs. The rookie paceman bowled short and wide, inviting Strauss to hook at will and Trescothick to take him for three successive boundaries through the off-side. The transformation of England - and indeed the pitch - was illustrated by their lunch score of 137-0, just two runs fewer than their entire first-innings effort. South Africa looked seriously bereft of options in the afternoon, with skipper Graeme Smith fruitlessly turning to himself, Steyn returning to the attack and Nicky Boje failing to threaten.',\n",
       " \"Pollock was the only one to bother England's rampant openers, beating the outside edge of both batsmen. But there was to be no moving the batsmen as they rose through the ranks of England's greatest first-wicket stands. England's previous best in Durban - 160 by Wally Hammond and Bob Wyatt 73 years ago - fell away, and 31 runs later a new record for all teams at the ground was set. When the 200-run mark was passed, it was the first time England's opening wicket had done so since Graeme Gooch and Mike Atherton against Australia in 1991.\",\n",
       " \"The openers reached triple figures within moments of each other, Trescothick for the ninth time and Strauss for the fourth - and second in two Tests. Both carried on in the same vein after tea, with Trescothick hoicking Boje over mid-wicket for six and Strauss striking successive fours in the same over. South Africa's only hope looked to be the new ball, and the dependable Pollock finally gave the hosts something to cheer when Trescothick edged a simple catch behind late on. Strauss, chanceless all day, next over gave South Africa a sniff when edging Ntini low down to second slip, where Martin van Jaarsveld spilled a tough one-handed chance. Bad light ceased play 11 overs ahead of schedule, and play will start 30 minutes early on day four.\",\n",

Asim Kamal top scored for the visitors with a well-made 87, but Australia were always in control after building a first-innings lead of 264. And on a turning wicket Shane Warne took 4-111 and Stuart MacGill 3-83. Australia took three wickets during the morning session to reduce Pakistan to 172-4, still 92 runs behind the home team's first-innings total. It seemed at one point as though stubborn resistance would limit the visitors to the loss of Yasir Hameed during the first session of the day. But with lunch approaching the Australians swung the balance of the session in their favour with two wickets in two balls. Yousef Youhana was bowled by MacGill for 30 before Younis Khan was trapped lbw to Shane Watson to become the all-rounder's first Test victim.\",\n",

Shortly before the scheduled tea interval Australia claimed the extra half hour as they went in search of victory. But Asim Kamal, partnered by Mohammad Asif, who scored his first runs in Test cricket, put on 55 for the last wicket to set Australia a meagre target for victory.

Previously, only 10 degrees for fast bowlers and five degrees for spinners were permitted. Murali\\'s arm was measured at 14 degrees while bowling his \"doosra\" prior to the delivery\\'s banning.',\n",

The panel met in Dubai and studied video evidence of bowlers as well as hearing the opinions of the three biomechanical experts.',\n",
       " '\"The scientific evidence is overwhelming,\" Holding said. \"When bowlers who to the naked eye look to have pure actions are thoroughly analysed with the sophisticated technology now in place, they are likely to be shown as straightening their arm by 11 and in some cases 12 degrees. \"Under a strict interpretation of the law, these players are breaking the rules. \"The game needs to deal with this reality and make its judgment as to how it accommodates this fact.\" De Silva tipped fellow Sri Lankan Murali, the second-highest Test wicket-taker with 532 victims, to raise the bar even higher. \"He has so much cricket left in him that I have little doubt that Murali will reach the 700-wicket mark in Test cricket,\" he said. \"The ICC has done the right thing and he can go ahead with his usual repertoire of bowling. \"I am glad for Murali, who will be a relieved man now.\"',\n",

Harbhajan, whose action first came under scrutiny in 1998, has taken 189 Test wickets and claimed 117 victims in one-day internationals. Elliott said he was confident he had bowled with a similar intensity to that of Test matches during the camera test. \"We can make a comparison to the video from the match when he was reported - things such as ball speed, arm rotation, position of the body and technique,\" he explained. \"We had two arbiters in Daryl Foster and Harbhajan himself to give a ranking to each delivery so that we were confident they were quality deliveries.\"',\n",

The ICC is not impressed that it has taken so long for the British government to seek a meeting with Mani, especially as it had first mooted a move from Lord's in June last year. Mani told Caborn that if circumstances had changed he would be prepared to consider asking his members to remain in London. But whatever the Department of Culture, Media and Sport can offer, the biggest factor for the ICC - tax breaks - remains something that only the Treasury can rule on.

Katich then made 99 as the Aussies established an intimidating 415-run lead in reaching 202-3 at stumps. It places Australia on the brink of a first series win in India for 35 years.

Skipper Adam Gilchrist delayed taking the new ball for a few overs, but was rewarded almost instantly when he did. Firstly, Gillespie gave Clarke the first of two catches at third slip to get rid of Agit Agarkar. And soon India's last line of defence was dismantled when Glenn McGrath and first slip Warne combined to oust Kaif for 55 - a second successive Test match fifty. India were nine down when Kartik fell to Gillespie - one of eight to perish to catches off the edge of the bat - and all that remained was for the paceman to bag his first five-wicket haul against India with the dismissal of last man Zaheer. With plenty of time left in the Test and an opportunity to rest his attack presenting itself, Gilchrist chose not to enforce the follow-on despite Australia's 213-run first-innings lead.\",\n",

It was largely one-way traffic once Australia had negotiated a tough, run-free 40-minute period after lunch, with Justin Langer surviving a couple of close lbw appeals to put on 80 for the second wicket with Katich. Langer's scratchy stay came to an end just after tea when trying to hit Kartik out of the park but succeeding only in holing out at deep mid-wicket. Another meaningful partnership was in the offing, however, and Katich and the in-form Martyn upped the scoring rate in a deflating period for India. Katich was supreme against the spinners, playing patiently square of the wicket and using his feet to move into the 90s with sucessive on-driven boundaries off the hugely disappointing Anil Kumble (0-62). But fate - and Kartik - conspired against Katich, who stepped back in his crease and was plumb lbw to register the 74th score of 99 in Test cricket history. Martyn and Clarke were untroubled in the closing overs against a tiring attack, the latter announcing his arrival at the crease with two glorious boundaries in one Kumble over.\",\n",

The last few Ashes encounters have seen England decimated by injury, but Vaughan is hoping not to have this burden during the summer.',\n",

We would rather disappoint a few players than not have enough.\" England will be buoyed up by the 2-1 Test series victory in South Africa, but Vaughan is pragmatic enough to know that Australia are the benchmark by how his side will be judged.

He has been in good form with both bat and ball in domestic cricket, making his highest first-class score of 115 and taking eight wickets in the game as Auckland beat Northern Districts in the State Championship. New Zealand breathed a sigh of relief when Brendon McCullum and Scott Styris were cleared of code of conduct charges on Thursday.',\n",

Simon Katich is the likely replacement for Hayden in the Australian team, but they face a dilemma over who should open with Adam Gilchrist. Katich went in first in a one-day game against India at the start of the year but prefers the middle order and they could opt to promote Darren Lehmann instead. Lehmann has only opened four times in 110 limited overs internationals, but his last three scores in that role have been 92 not out, 50 not out and 119. The state of the pitch will also be a major factor in deciding the make-up of their attack. Michael Kasprowicz could return in place of spinner Brad Hogg as part of a four-pronged pace attack.

His international career consisted of 21 Tests and he scored two hundreds to help Ray Illingworth\\'s England side win the Ashes in Australia in 1970-71. \"He was a great buddy and a loyal servant,\" Denness told BBC Sport. \"In cricketing terms, he probably didn\\'t have a lot of natural gifts, but with the gifts he had, he worked so hard at it that he deserved to reach the top which he did by opening the batting for England.\"',\n",
       " 'Kent chairman Carl Openshaw said Luckhurst had been \"loved, admired and respected\" by everyone at the club. \"Brian Luckhurst has been at the heart of Kent Cricket for the past 50 years, firstly as an outstanding player, then in a variety of administrative capacities and finally as an immensely popular president. \"Throughout that time, he was always caring, loyal and totally committed to Kent,\" he continued. Born in Sittingbourne, Luckhurst joined the staff at Canterbury at the age of 15 and during his first-class career made more than 22,000 first-class runs at an average of 38, including 48 centuries.',\n",
       " 'He was a member of the Kent team which dominated county cricket in the 1970s when they won nine trophies outright and also shared the County Championship in 1977. Luckhurst was 31 when his chance to play for England came along in a home series against a Rest of the World XI in 1970. He was named in the Ashes squad the following winter and marked his official Test debut, as Geoff Boycott\\'s opening partner, by scoring 74 and 20 not out in a draw against Australia in Brisbane. The following game in Perth saw him bat for almost six hours to score 131 and he also made 109 in the fifth Test at Melbourne as England took the series 2-0. \"It was a terrific performance and he, along with Geoff Boycott and John Edrich, were the three who scored all the runs. \"In one match, I think it was at Melbourne, he wouldn\\'t take his glove off at the break because he thought he had damaged a knuckle. In fact, he had fractured the knuckle but he got a hundred,\" said Denness.',\n",
       " 'Luckhurst made an unbeaten 108 in his first Test on English soil against Pakistan and added another century against India later in the 1971 season. Although he appeared in three one-day internationals, his style was better suited to Test cricket, but he lost his place after the 1974-75 tour to Australia when the pace and ferocity of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson proved too much for England, who lost 4-1. \"It was a torrid time for all of us,\" added Denness, who was England captain on that tour. \"He was a great tourist, a great man to have [around] and a great performer. If you look at his Test record, it\\'s a very good record.\"',\n",
       " 'After retiring from the Kent first team, Luckhurst captained the second XI before moving into coaching and later had a spell as a sports centre manager. In 1985, he made an unexpected return to action when Kent suddenly found themselves with only 10 players against the touring Australians. In recent years he worked in the club\\'s commercial department before taking on the presidency. But he was diagnosed with cancer in May 2004. \"Over the last 50 years I have faced many challenges - this is going to be the biggest,\" he said at the time.

The left-hander's 16th Test ton came off 209 balls and included 15 fours. The hosts fell to 21-1 at stumps, with Matthew Hoggard trapping home skipper Graeme Smith lbw for five. To win, South Africa will have to break their own chasing record at the ground, which they set in 2002 when scoring 340 to beat Australia. On day three South Africa waited all day for a wicket, but three came along at once when play resumed on the fourth. Makhaya Ntini was the man to ignite the flame, tempting Andrew Strauss into a dalliance outside the off-stump which was pouched by Martin van Jaarsveld at third slip.\",\n",
       " \"The prolific opener had added only four runs to his overnight 132 when departing. Ntini followed up with the wicket of Michael Vaughan, whose poor run continued when he was cramped up by a short ball and gloved behind for 10, taking his four-innings aggregate this series to 53. Shaun Pollock was doing a fine job tying up his end, and England soon fell to 314-4 when Jacques Kallis put an end to Mark Butcher's painful 70-ball 13. It left the visitors' leading by just 121 with the middle-order exposed, but the lack of depth in South Africa's attack gave England the chance to stabilise. With Graeme Smith forced to rely on support acts Dale Steyn (1-122) and Nicky Boje (1-163), England reasserted thanks to Thorpe and his partnerships with Flintoff and Jones. Flintoff, careful to avoid a pair of ducks, was indecisive early on, edging streakily for four and being struck on the shoulder in one Steyn over. But the all-rounder ended the first session with a full-blooded cover-drive that sent Steyn to the fence, and he carried on in similar vein after the interval. A six off Pollock over long-on was followed by two more off Ntini over square-leg, and Flintoff emulated Thorpe by reaching 50 with a boundary. South Africa's only strike of the afternoon came when Smith offered a long-hop to Flintoff and enticed an edge, which AB de Villiers gloved behind the stumps. England's scoring rate increased when Jones came to the crease, and he complemented Thorpe's grafting approach with some abrasive strokeplay. The keeper blazed 73 off 82 balls, with 10 fours and two sixes, as England chased quick runs prior to the declaration, joining Thorpe in top-edging the hapless Steyn over the keeper's head on numerous occasions. South Africa were forced to place a fielder at long-stop, but the runs continued to flow until Jones holed out at long-on to give Boje his sole strike. Ashley Giles, who will be fit to bowl in day five after suffering back spasms, came out to bat, but his swift removal by Steyn prompted the declaration.\",\n",

Bacher's fifty took 65 balls but he only faced eight more before holing out to Hamilton Masakadza off Utseya.

New Zealand crumbled to 86-6 in reply but Chris Cairns hit 50 off 40 balls and Kyle Mills and Daniel Vettori put on 70 to keep their side in the hunt. But they were eventually all out for 244 and the three-match series will now be decided in Brisbane on Friday. The game came to an end at the start of the 48th over when Chris Harris, who bravely came out to bat in his 250th one-day game despite a shoulder injury, was bowled by a yorker from Glenn McGrath. Mills was left high and dry on 44 not out after a magnificent 26-ball innings, featuring four big sixes. There were plenty of anxious faces among the Australian fans during his ninth wicket stand with Vettori (33), who was finally run out by Ricky Ponting's underarm throw. Home skipper Ponting had earlier chosen to bat after winning the toss and was rewarded as Adam Gilchrist took the attack to the New Zealand seamers. He struck a six and eight fours to reach his half century off only 37 deliveries, before perishing for 60 in cavalier fashion as a pull shot off Scott Styris was caught by Nathan Astle at deep square leg.\",\n",

Matthew Hayden (43) was run out by Mathew Sinclair, Damien Martyn was lbw to Mills for five and Andrew Symonds faced only two balls before he was trapped in front by Vettori. Michael Clarke was next to go for six when he edged a ball from Chris Cairns to keeper Brendon McCullum. But Darren Lehmann and Brad Hogg prevented the innings from going into freefall, adding 74 in 17 overs for the seventh wicket. Lehmann was run out, leaving Hogg (41 not out) and Brett Lee (10 not out) to see the total past 250 to leave the Kiwis facing a tough target.',\n",

Captain Stephen Fleming fell lbw for 34 to left-arm spinner Hogg, who proved the most successful Australian bowler with figures of 3-45. The middle order followed in quick succession and it looked like the home side would wrap things up in double quick time. Cairns counter attacked with two sixes and four fours before Gillespie brought his innings to an end, leaving Mills and Vettori to try and secure an unlikely victory. The required rate came down to a run per ball thanks to Mills' big-hitting exploits, but Harris was greeted by a short-pitched ball aimed at his chest and a ferocious full toss from Lee after Vettori had been dismissed. The veteran, whose suffered a torn rotator cuff while fielding earlier in the game, collected four singles but his gallantry was in vain as McGrath produced the perfect delivery to bring the game to an end.\",\n",

Ma\\'a Nonu then found his way through the Barbarians defence to give his side a 19-7 half-time lead.

But Sheridan favours the loosehead side of the scrum and a more likely scenario is for uncapped Bell - who was among the tryscorers when England A beat France A 30-20 nine days ago - to be drafted in. Robinson also has an injury worry over centre Olly Barkley, who withdrew from Bath's starting line-up to face Gloucester last weekend.\",\n",

Despite Barkley's three missed penalties in the 18-17 defeat against France, he is expected to retain his place at inside centre, although Leicester's in-form prospect Ollie Smith would be an obvious replacement. Bath coach John Connolly rates Barkley as no better than a 50/50 chance to make the Dublin trip. Uncapped fly-half Andy Goode has been named in a 30-man training squad for the Ireland game, and he strengthened his selection claims by kicking 28 points during Leicester's record 83-10 win against Newcastle on Sunday.

The news is just the latest blow for coach Andy Robinson, who has seen his side lose their opening two matches in the 2005 Six Nations. Robinson is already without World Cup winners Jonny Wilkinson, Will Greenwood, Mike Tindall, Richard Hill and Trevor Woodman through injury. Vickery has broken the radius, a large bone in his forearm. He only returned to the England side last weekend after a long-term back injury, which was followed by a fractured eye socket.

Llewellyn is on a one-season deal with French club side Narbonne, but said he may consider retiring from all rugby. \"I don\\'t know what I\\'ll do next year, whether to carry on playing or make a change in my career,\" Llewellyn said. \"Narbonne are really keen for me to stay on for next year, so I\\'ve got to decide whether to stay on there or maybe go somewhere else, but ultimitely coaching is where I\\'d like to end up. \"I\\'ve done all the coaching awards and everything you can do in that respect, so it\\'s just hopefully getting a chance somewhere.\" Fellow locks Robert Sidoli and Brent Cockbain, who both scored tries in Saturday\\'s Six Nations win in Italy, are Wales coach Mike Ruddock\\'s preferred starters in the second row.',\n",
       " 'With the resurgence of the Dragons\\' Ian Gough and the adaptibility of lock-cum-flanker Jon Thomas on the bench, Llewellyn has not yet made a match-day squad this Six Nations campaign. But the former Neath and Ospreys player is still targetting one last outing in the red shirt. \"If I do get on the field then brilliant, although the boys are doing really well and I\\'m very pleased for them,\" Llewellyn added. \"We\\'ve had some really tough years in Wales and the players have been through a hell of a lot. \"Sometimes the easiest thing would have been to throw the towel in and walk away, but a few of us dug in there and it\\'s really nice to see some of the boys getting the rewards now. \"I was going to retire at the end of the last Six Nations, I\\'d even told some of the boys in the squad about it. \"But Mike (Ruddock) asked me to carry on for another season, which I\\'ve done, still part of the squad, still trying to help them out as much as I can.\" Llewellyn made his Wales debut in 1989 against New Zealand as a 20-year-old, having caught the selectors\\' eyes in the All Blacks\\' tour match against Neath.

But Charlie Hodgson and Barkley missed six penalties between them, while Yachvili landed six for France to put the visitors in front. England could have won the game with three minutes left, but Hodgson pushed an easy drop goal opportunity wide. It was a dismal defeat for England, coming hard on the heels of an opening Six Nations loss in Wales. They should have put the game well beyond France's reach, but remarkably remained scoreless for the entire second half. A scrappy opening quarter saw both sides betray the lack of confidence engendered by poor opening displays against Wales and Scotland respectively. Hodgson had an early opportunity to settle English nerves but pushed a straightforward penalty attempt wide. But a probing kick from France centre Damien Traille saw Mark Cueto penalised for holding on to the ball in the tackle, Yachvili giving France the lead with a kick from wide out.\",\n",

A spell of tit-for-tat kicking emphasised the caution on both sides, until England refused a possible three points to kick a penalty to the corner, only to botch the subsequent line-out. But England made the breakthrough after 19 minutes, when a faltering move off the back of a scrum led to the opening try. Jamie Noon took a short pass from Barkley and ran a good angle to plough through Yann Delaigue's flimsy tackle before sending his centre partner through to score at the posts.\",\n",
       " \"Hodgson converted and added a penalty after one of several French infringements on the floor for a 10-3 lead. The fly-half failed to dispense punishment though with a scuffed attempt after France full-back Pepito Elhorga, scragged by Lewsey, threw the ball into touch. Barkley also missed two longer-range efforts as the first half drew to a close, but by then England had scored a second converted try. After a series of phases lock Danny Grewcock ran hard at the French defence and off-loaded out of Sylvain Marconnet's tackle to Lewsey. The industrious wing cut back in on an angle and handed off hooker Sebastien Bruno to sprint over. After a dire opening to the second half, France threw on three forward replacements in an attempt to rectify the situation, wing Jimmy Marlu having already departed injured. Yachvili nibbled away at the lead with a third penalty after 51 minutes.\",\n",
       " \"And when Lewis Moody was twice penalised - for handling in a ruck and then straying offside - the scrum-half's unerring left boot cut the deficit to two points.

Nelson Town met Nelson College on 14 May, 1870, the Town triumphing by two goals to nil, instigating a game that would become a national obsession and come to dominate the country's sporting passions. The game appealed to the Kiwi psyche and quickly spread, the native Maoris finding a particular empathy with the sport's warrior ethos. In 1888 a British team led by AE Stoddart toured New Zealand and Australia, and soon after a Maori named Joe Warbrick and an English ex-pat called Thomas Eyton decided to gather a combined New Zealand team.\",\n",
       " \"Twenty-two Maori and four 'pakiha' formed the 'New Zealand Native Team,' who played a total of 107 matches in New Zealand, Australia and the UK. The integration of white and Maori was a reflecion of enlightened New Zealand rugby and society, even if the British press were somewhat mystified by the pre-match tradition of the Maori war dance, the Haka! The other great symbol of New Zealand rugby, the all black kit with the silver fern on the breast, was proposed by Tom Ellison at the first annual meeting of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union in 1893. New Zealand played their first international against Australia in 1903, the Kiwis triumphing 22-3 in Sydney, and the following year an official British touring team came to New Zealand for the first time. The tourists had gone through Australia undefeated but their captain, David Revell Bedell-Sivright, created animosity in New Zealand with his patronising attitude. The Kiwis shocked the rugby world with a 9-3 triumph in Wellington, sparking great celebrations across the country, but Bedell-Sivright churlishly suggested that the victors would have no chance when they visited the UK.\",\n",
       " 'Their opportunity to prove him wrong came in 1905 with the first official New Zealand tour to Europe. The tourists won their early games with a quick-thinking, inventive approach, but press criticism began to grow over their 2-3-2 scrum formation that left a \\'roving\\' forward free to disrupt opposition attacks. The tactic was effective, two late tries seeing the Kiwis to a 12-7 win over Scotland, before Ireland were despatched 15-0 in Dublin. A huge crowd at Crystal Palace convulsed with laughter at the sight of the Haka - but the smiles were soon wiped from their faces when the tourists ran in five tries in a 15-0 hammering of England. New Zealand headed to Wales to meet a country in the midst of its first \\'Golden Age,\\' and the encounter would be the first in a series of controversial clashes between the sides. An excellent try on the left wing by Teddy Morgan sealed a 3-0 win in a hard-fought encounter at Cardiff Arms Park, but post-match talk was dominated by a Bob Deans try that was ruled out by Scottish referee John Dallas. Dallas said that Deans was tackled short, but the Kiwi said he was dragged back into the field of play after grounding a try - on his death-bed three years later he exclaimed: \"I did score that try in Cardiff.\"',\n",
       " \"Four of the 1905 All Blacks went over to the newly formed 'All Golds' rugby league side soon after the tour, but New Zealand were strong enough to crush an Anglo-Welsh touring team in 1908. The first South Africa tour of New Zealand in 1921 saw honours shared in a three-Test series, starting the greatest rivalry in rugby - and the long-running controversy between the countries over the All Blacks' inclusion of Maori players. The awesome 1924-5 All Black tourists became known as 'The Invincibles' after winning all 30 of their games in France, Britain and Ireland, including a crushing 19-0 victory over Wales at St Helen's. Despite their success, the All Blacks' 2-3-2 scrum formation left them somewhat short of possession at times, and the flaws were exploited by the Springboks in South Africa in 1928. Employing the modern 3-4-1 scrum line-up against the New Zealand 'rover' system for the first time, South African teams defeated the All Blacks in five games and the Test series was drawn two-all. The controversial New Zealand scrum method finally disappeared after the 1930 Lions tour (a series won 3-1 by New Zealand), the Lions manager describing the tactic as 'cheating,' prompting the International Rugby Board to rule that three men had to pack down in the front row of the scrum.\",\n",
       " \"The All Blacks' 1935 European tour started inauspiciously with an 11-3 loss to a Swansea side inspired by teenage, schoolboy half-backs Hayden Tanner and Willie Davies. A thrilling Test at Cardiff Arms Park went to Wales 13-12, although the winning try from Geoffrey Rees-Jones was controversial following an illegal Claude Davey tackle in the build-up. New Zealand's next visit to Wales in 1953 proved difficult as they lost 8-3 to Cardiff and drew 6-6 at Swansea. The All Blacks were on top in the Test with Wales at the Arms Park, but the teams were locked at 8-8 when a Clem Thomas cross kick was gathered by Ken Jones for a famous, match-winning try. The tourists made some amends with wins over the other home nations, before a 19-5 success over the Barbarians in an Arms Park thriller. New Zealand built from that tour, and by the time they returned in 1963-4 they were undoubtedly the leading side in the world.\",\n",
       " 'That made the shock all the greater when a drop goal by student John Uzzell gave Newport an unlikely 3-0 win over the tourists at Rodney Parade. Wilson Whinneray\\'s side rallied to beat Wales 6-0, their first win at the Arms Park in four attempts, and went unbeaten through the rest of the tour, but when they returned home the first question put to them was: \"What happened in Newport?\" The only blemish on the record of the awesome 1967 tourists was a draw with East Wales, as they beat the full Wales team 13-6 in Cardiff to take the lead in the series between the countries for the first time. That lead was increased with two comfortable wins for the home side in New Zealand in 1969, the first time Wales had toured the country as an independent team.',\n",
       " 'A ferocious game at the Arms Park in 1972 was edged 19-16 by the All Blacks, a measure of revenge for the defeat inflicted on New Zealand by the Carwyn James-inspired Lions of 1971.',\n",
       " 'James guided Llanelli to a famous 9-3 win over the tourists at Stradey Park, though, and in the final game of the tour the Barbarians defeated the All Blacks 23-11 in Cardiff in a game regarded by many as the greatest ever played. New Zealand defeated a Wales XV 12-3 at the Arms Park in a non-cap game in 1974, but it was the 1978 game in Cardiff that would reignite the history of controversy between the two countries.',\n",

Television pictures clearly showed that he dived, but English referee Roger Quittenton was fooled and awarded a penalty, duly converted by Brian McKechnie for a 13-12 win. Since that infamous game, the competition has largely left Wales v New Zealand fixtures as the men in red have slipped from the pinnacle of the world game. A crushing 23-3 win for New Zealand in Cardiff in the Welsh Rugby Union's 1980 centenary game was a sign of things to come. The new professionalism in the southern hemisphere game that had left Europe behind was shown as the All Blacks swatted Wales aside 49-6 in Brisbane in the semi-final of the inaugural World Cup. The Kiwis went on to claim the Cup, and would inflict further misery on Wales on their ill-fated 1988 tour of New Zealand.\",\n",

After also taking some fearful beatings in the provincial games, Wales captain Jonathan Davies returned home calling for urgent change in the national game, but as his views were ignored he - along with a generation of Wales' best players - chose to head north to rugby league.\",\n",
       " \"A 34-9 win in Cardiff followed for New Zealand in 1989, and at the 1995 World Cup Wales' big talk was made to look embarrassing as the All Blacks eased to victory in Johannesburg. A crushing 42-7 Kiwi triumph in Wembley followed in 1997, and as Wales' misery increased they turned to New Zealand for their salvation in the shape of coaches Graham Henry and Steve Hansen. There was a temporary resurgence in the Welsh game, but when an experimental New Zealand side came to Cardiff's new Millennium Stadium in 2002 they left with a 43-17 victory.\",\n",
       " 'A bruising 55-3 defeat followed for Wales in Hamilton in 2003 as Hansen built towards the World Cup, but in Australia it was a remarkable performance against the All Blacks that gave his side renewed hope. Wales were given no chance going into the game, but in the course of the match they rediscovered the value of attacking flair to lead 37-33 early in the second half. New Zealand rallied to a 53-37 win, but the style shown by Wales has been used as an inspiration as they look to a better future. They now face an All Blacks team led by Henry and Hansen, coming to Europe with a weakened squad at the end of a long season. An encouraging display against South Africa has inspired a confident Wales camp to believe they can claim their first win over the men in black for over 50 years.

       " 'A year to remember for Irish',\n",
       " 'There used to be one subliminal moment during a year in Irish rugby that stood out more than most.',\n",
       " \"Well, at least there used to one. Now there is a handful to look back with a mixture of satisfaction, and sorrow. It has been quite a year for the Irish, and not just with Eddie O'Sullivan's Triple Crown winning international outfit either. Right down through the ranks Irish rugby is creating waves and upsetting the more established teams in the game. But most of the kudos will go to O'Sullivan and his merry band of warriors who not only collected their first Triple Crown for 29 years, but also finished their autumn campaign with a 100% record. For the second year in succession they also finished in the runners-up spot in the RBS Six Nations. But in the three games in November which included a victory over Tri-Nations champions and Grand Slam chasing South Africa, Ireland finsihed the year on a high. The 18-12 victory at Lansdowne Road was only their second victory over the Boks after the initial success back in 1965. That success was revenge for the consecutive defeats in Blomefontein and Cape Town in the summer. Those two reverses and the 35-17 flop against France, were the only dark patches in an otherwise excellent 12 months. But the big one, of course, was the 19-13 defeat of World Cup champions England on their precious Twickenham turf. The winning try was conceived in O'Sullivan's mind, perfectly executed by the team and finished immaculately by Girvan Dempsey. For me, the try of the Championship. O'Sullivan's career is now in vertical take-off mode. It is no wonder that Sir Clive Woodward has elevated the Galway-based coach to head the Lions Test side. Not only that, but a fair majority of the present Ireland side will be wearing red next June in New Zealand.\",\n",
       " \"There can be no doubt that Ireland's representation will be the biggest ever, albeit in a proposed 44-man squad. In Brian O'Driscoll and Paul O'Connell, Ireland have now the two front-runners for the captaincy. Gordon D'Arcy, whose career began as a teenager back in 1999, finally arrived when he was named the Six Nations Player of the Tournament. But it was not only the senior squad that brought kudos to Ireland, the youngsters strutted their stuff on the big stage as well. The under-21 squad confounded the doubters as they went all the way to the World Cup final in Scotland only to be beaten by a powerful All Black side in the decider. The young Irish boys had stated their intentions earlier in the season when they finished runners-up to England in the Six Nations under-21 tournament. On the provincial front, Leinster, for second year in succession, blew it when the Heineken Cup looked a good wager. While Ulster finished runners-up in their very tight group for the second season in succession, it was Munster again flying the flag for the Irish. Looking to reach their third final, they went down 37-32 to eventual winners Wasps in what many beileve was the most competitive and thunderous game ever witnessed at Lansdowne Road. How Wasps recovered from that energy-sapping duel, and then go onto to defeat Toulouse in the final was anybody's guess. Ulster, meanwhile, just lost out to adding the inaugural Celtic Cup in winning the Celtic League when they were pipped at the post by the Scarlets in the final game.\",\n",
       " \"Ulster, however, took time to start the new season under new coach Mark McCall. The once famous Ravenhill fortress was breached four times as Ulster only manged five wins from their first 12 outings in the Celtic League. Leinster are again looking the most potent outfit going into 2005, but whether they can take that final step under Declan Kidney is another thing. On the down side, Irish rugby was hit by a number of tragedies. Teenage star John McCall died while playing for the Ireland against New Zealand in the under-19 World Cup game in Durban. That happened only 10 days after he led Royal Armagh to their first Ulster Schools' Cup success since 1977. The death of former Ireland coach and Lions flanker Mike Doyle in a car crash in Northern Ireland shocked the rugby fraternity A larger than life character, Doyle had coached Ireland to the Triple Crown in 1985, the last time that goal had been achieved before this season. Ulster rugby also suffered the sudden deaths of well-known Londonderry YM player Jim Huey, Coleraine's Jonathan Hutchinson, and Belfast Harlequins lock Johnny Poole. They all passed away long before the full-time whistle.\",\n",

It means Rahul Dravid will remain at number three and VVS Laxman at six, despite the latter averaging 53.5 at first drop in Test cricket. \"To be honest, Dravid has batted better than Laxman at three,\" Ganguly added. \"If you ask any batsman, he would like to bat higher up, as it gives a greater opportunity to score. \"While batting lower down the order, you have to play more with the tail.\" Ganguly gave his backing to Gautam Gambhir, banishing speculation Yuvraj Singh could be asked to open the batting again after a failed experiment against Australia last year.',\n",

He was part of the first Windies team to defeat England in a Test series in 1950, before quitting the first-class game to focus on his legal career. Rae then went on to become president of the West Indies Cricket Board, a position he held from 1981-1988. In his book, A History of West Indies Cricket, former Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley said Rae \"brought to the presidency some of the most important characteristics of the finest administrative leaders, a deep sense of tradition with a mind always open to change\". He praised Rae\\'s behind the scenes work with Sir Don Bradman to bring the West Indies and Australia players involved in Kerry Packer\\'s World Series back into the cricket establishment. During his time as president, a number of West Indies players were given life bans for going on unauthorised tours to South Africa. Rae\\'s playing career began in 1946-47 and he soon earned a place in the West Indies team, marking his first series with centuries against India in Bombay (now Mumbai) and Madras (Chennai). Part of a strong opening partnership with Jeff Stollmeyer, he is best remembered for his part in the 1950 tour to England when he made 106 at Lord\\'s and 109 at The Oval as West Indies won the series 3-1. He only played six Tests thereafter, his last against India at Port of Spain in February 1953. \"Allan meant so much to our cricket, not only as a player, but also as a hard-working administrator,\" said Bryan Breese, chief executive of the Jamaica Cricket Association. \"He even neglected his legal practice at times because of his dedication to cricket in Jamaica.\"',\n",

The game was as exciting as it comes, with a much-improved England side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way. One can understand that frustration. There was no doubt that Ireland had the rub of the green in their 19-13 victory, but the reaction from the England camp may not have endeared them to the sport\\'s \"blazers\".

However, one has to credit Ireland flanker Johnny O'Connor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown.

Two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied England and allowed Ireland to hold on. The first was Denis Hickie's brilliant double tackle in the right-hand corner. He gobbled up Cueto from another Hodgson cross-field kick, then regained his feet to stop Lewsey from scoring a certain try. Ireland's second-row colossus Paul O'Connell was equally superb. England had turned Ireland one way then the other, and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating. England prop Matt Stevens ran in at full steam to suck in a few more tacklers. Unfortunately he ran into O'Connell who hit him hard - very hard - and then wrestled the ball away for a crucial turnover. That spoke volumes about Ireland's back-foot display, with defensive coach Mike Ford taking a bow at the end. To win a game like that showed that Ireland have moved forward.

England fly-half Charlie Hodgson nailed the conversion from out on the left, but almost immediately O'Gara, winning his 50th cap, answered with two penalties in quick succession. England were awarded a penalty of their own on the halfway line after 20 minutes, and Hodgson, the villain at Twickenham, coolly bisected the posts. The first quarter was marked by periods of tactical kicking, but it was Ireland who were showing more willingness to spread the ball wide to their eager and inventive backs. A series of probes led by the talismanic O'Driscoll, back from hamstring injury, resulted in a penalty but Ireland chose to kick for touch.\",\n",

As the interval approached, wing Josh Lewsey was the catalyst for England's most promising attack. The Wasps star raced up his touchline and Hodgson's cross-kick put in Mark Cueto for an apparent score, but the Sale wing was ruled to have started in front of the kicker. England began the second half well and had Ireland pinned in their own half. But another English indiscretion on a rare Irish break-out awarded O'Gara a kick at goal, which he missed.

O'Gara missed a penalty which would have put Ireland nine points clear, and the home crowd breathed a sigh of relief when Hodgson's cross-kick was fumbled by lock Ben Kay near the line. Anticipation of a home win sent the noise level sky-high, but O'Gara missed another chance to seal the game with a wayward drop-goal attempt. Inside the last 10 minutes, England poured forward, spurred on by scrum-half Matt Dawson, who replaced Leicester's Harry Ellis. But despite one near miss with the pack over the line - not checked on the TV replay by referee Jonathan Kaplan - England were unable to pull off a face-saving win.

His contribution improved in the second half, but England clearly need more of a playmaker in the inside centre role. Up front, the line-out remains fallible, despite a superb performance from Chris Jones, whose athleticism came to the fore after stepping into the side for Moody. It is more likely the Leicester flanker will return on the open side for the more physical challenge posed by the French forwards, with Andy Hazell likely to make way.

Three further O'Gara penalties extended Ireland's lead to 17-6 as the game entered the final quarter. Two Percy Montgomery penalties set up a frantic finish but Ireland held out to claim a famous victory. Ireland began strongly and were never led, but the match was tense and closely fought throughout. Aware of the threat posed by the South Africans, Ireland pressed hard from the outset, and played some impressive rugby while searching for a breakthrough. Early on, Denis Hickie thought he was in for a try after a delightful backline move but Shane Horgan's pass was adjudged to have gone forward by referee Paul Honiss.\",\n",
       " \"Ireland continued to press and they showed their intent by opting for a line-out in the 19th minute when three straight-forward points were on offer. Another South African infringement a minute later led to Ireland's first points - O'Gara took a quick tap-penalty and charged over the opposition line for an Irish try. The Springboks could feel hard done by as captain John Smit had his back to the play when O'Gara pounced after referee Honiss had told the skipper to warn his own players after consistent infringements. Stung by the score, the South Africans almost replied with a try of their own within 60 seconds with Geordan Murphy's ankle-tap tackle denying a certain try for Percy Montgomery. However, the Springboks did win a penalty a minute later which Montgomery easily slotted to cut Ireland's lead to 5-3.\",\n",
       " \"Ireland got out of jail when the South Africans had a three-to-one overlap near the Irish line only to waste the chance. After the sustained Springboks pressure, the Irish produced an attack of their own in the 34th minute which culminated with O'Gara's clever drop-goal to restore his side's lead to five points which remained the margin at half-time. Sustained Irish pressure immediately after half-time was rewarded by another O'Gara penalty. However, Montgomery responded quickly by slotting over a superb penalty from near the right touchline to cut Ireland's lead to five points again. Montgomery then burst through the Irish defence in the 48th minute and it took a superb Girvan Dempsey tackle to prevent a try. The South Africans suffered a double-blow in the 52nd minute when Schalk Burger was sin-binned for the second week in a row after killing the ball and O'Gara punished the transgression by notching another penalty.\",\n",

Byrne said: \"It was a really, really hard game but from one to 15 in our team we worked really, really hard. \"We just had to stick to our defensive pattern, trust ourselves and trust those around us. All round it was fantastic.\" Ireland captain Brian O\\'Driscoll, who scored his side\\'s only try, said: \"We are delighted, we felt if we performed well then we would win but with England also having played very well it makes it all the sweeter. \"We did get the bounce of the ball and some days that happens and you\\'ve just got to jump on the back of it.\"',\n",

       " 'Controversy and Lawrence Dallaglio have never been very far away from each other throughout a glittering international career.',\n",
       " \"Even the end of his nine-year career came out of the blue, just four days before the start of the season. But then Dallaglio has always been his own man. Ever since emerging onto the international scene Dallaglio has polarised opinions. To supporters of England, Dallaglio could do no wrong. An integral part of a sustained period of success for England, Dallaglio's crowning glory was his part in the side that won the Rugby World Cup in 2003.\",\n",
       " 'Rival fans, meanwhile, have tended to take an alternative view, seeing Dallaglio as the epitome of the less agreeable characteristics of English rugby. Never afraid to speak his mind, be it to the referee or the opposition on the pitch, or his coach or the media off it, Dallaglio has sometimes rubbed people up the wrong way. Dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded England side which became the shock winners of the first Rugby Sevens World Cup in 1993. It took him another two years to graduate to the full England XV, but once there he proved to the manor born. Displaying maturity and physical power beyond his years, Dallaglio rapidly established himself as an automatic choice able to play any one of the three back-row positions at international standard.',\n",
       " \"Within two years of his debut, Dallaglio was offered the England captain's band, and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the 1997 Lions tour to South Africa. Although overlooked for the captaincy in favour of England team-mate Martin Johnson, he played a massive role in the 2-1 series victory. But after building up a seemingly unstoppable momentum, Dallaglio's career hit the buffers at speed in 1999.\",\n",
       " \"First came the last-minute defeat to Wales in which Dallaglio's decision not to kick for goal in the dying minutes was blamed for costing England a Grand Slam. Worse was to follow though as an infamous newspaper sting cost him his treasured England captaincy. With sensational allegations of drug use - of which he was subsequently cleared - splashed across the front pages, a devastated Dallaglio stepped down as England skipper. But he bounced back, getting his head down at club level before returning to the England fold, albeit now as a lieutenant to new captain Johnson. As a member of a new-look England side on the long road to World Cup glory - a journey not without mishaps as a succession of Grand Slams opportunities were spurned - Dallaglio emerged as a key performer once again.\",\n",
       " \"Yet another setback arrived in 2001 as a serious knee injury cut short Dallaglio's involvement on the Lions tour to Australia.\",\n",
       " 'Rumours began to circulate that his career was over but, in typical Dallaglio style, he embarked on a punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen. One effect of the injury was to rob Dallaglio of much of his pace, but ever the pragmatist, he reinvented himself as a close quarters number eight of the highest calibre.',\n",
       " \"The only player to play every minute of England's World Cup triumph in Australia, Dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure England's historic win, and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by England supporters. Following Johnson's retirement, Dallaglio's career came full circle as Woodward restored him as England captain. While England did not hit the heights in Dallaglio's second spell as captain, losing five of their eight post-World Cup Tests, Dallaglio led by example, leaving him as one of the few members of a squad lacking many World Cup stars to live up to expectations. Dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of England's most accomplished players, if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country.\",\n",
       " \"The problem now for England is how to replace the almost irreplaceable. The likes of Matt Dawson, Jonny Wilkinson, Phil Vickery and Hill have all been mentioned as contenders for Dallaglio's role as captain. But it is as a player that England will really struggle to replace the 32-year-old. Although players like Joe Worsley and Chris Jones are more than capable of stepping up, the fact that there is no stand-out candidate speaks volumes about Dallaglio's massive influence on English rugby.\",\n",

       " \"O'Gara kicked all of Ireland's points, with two dropped goals and five penalties, to give the home side a 100% record in their autumn internationals. An impressive Argentina appeared in control until the dying seconds. The Pumas shocked the Irish early on with a try from Federico Aramburu, and Felipe Contepomi kicked 14 points. The well-drilled and sharper Pumas out-played and out-thought Ireland in the early stages. Indiscipline allowed Argentina's Leinster fly-half Contepomi to open the scoring in the third minute with a straightforward penalty. He was on the mark again two minutes later when Argentina shocked a ragged Ireland with the first try of the game. Ireland turned the ball over and Manuel Contepomi broke through an unstructured defence before feeding his midfield partner Aramburu to sprint in under the posts. O'Gara finally got Ireland on the board with a dropped goal in the ninth minute only for Contepomi to rifle over his second penalty two minutes later. Playing into a strong wind and rain, Ireland continued to come second best in tight situations, and turnovers began to mount up against a rugged defence. O'Gara managed to land his second penalty in the 36th minute, but once again Contepomi replied in kind four minutes into first-half injury time. The second-half started as the first had ended. O'Gara rifled over another penalty in the 45th minute, but Contepomi matched it three minutes later. The upper-body strength of the Pumas never allowed Ireland to take control up front, while the three-quarters had no space to manoeuvre. Ireland had to rely on O'Gara's boot to keep in touch rather than any contrived running plays. The Munsterman landed two more penalties - one of them from 48 metres - to bring his team to within four points with 13 minutes on the clock remaining. And Ireland's chance came when Argentina's number eight Gonzalo Longo was yellow carded with six minutes to go for an offence in the line-out. O'Gara made no mistake as he rifled over his fifth penalty to set up a tense final few minutes. But Ireland showed great composure to get themselves into a position to allow O'Gara to thump over a massive drop goal to complete a tremendous, if fortuitous, comeback.\",\n",

After recovering from a trapped nerve in his back sustained at the end of September, the 31-year-old is relishing his role in the Tigers revival. \"I had six weeks out but fortunately I have resumed the sort of form I had before,\" he said.',\n",
       " '\"I am basically playing where it best suits Leicester. Obviously I can play scrum-half, fly-half or full-back at a moment\\'s notice. \"But playing on the wing actually gives me a bigger free role to come in where I am not expected and influence things.\" That has been apparent in parts one and two of the Wasps-Leicester trilogy in recent weeks. First, Healey came off his flank with an angled run to score an injury-time try that earned the Tigers a 17-17 draw in their Premiership meeting on 21 November. Then, in the first of their Heineken cup double header last Sunday, Healey slotted in at stand-off and delivered a superb cross-kick for Martin Corry to score the Tigers\\' third try. \"I caught \\'Cozza\\'s\\' eye a couple of phases before that and was hoping to get it to him on the full, but fortunately even with the bounce he managed to score,\" Healey recalled.',\n",

Bath director of rugby Jack Rowell, though, believes Williams fits the bill perfectly. \"He has been playing regular Heineken Cup and Celtic League rugby and he has a great affection for Bath,\" Rowell told Bath\\'s official website. \"We are delighted to be able to welcome him back to the club.\"',\n",

       " 'Gregory Ioannidis has submitted new evidence to a Greek athletics tribunal which he claims proves the former Olympic champion has no case to answer. Kenteris and compatriot Katerina Thanou were given provisional suspensions in December for failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics. The Greek tribunal is expected to give its verdict early next week. Kenteris and Thanou withdrew from the Athens Olympics last August after missing drugs tests on the eve of the opening ceremony. They were also alleged to have avoided tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago before the Games.',\n",
       " 'But Ioannidis said: \"Everything overwhelmingly shows that the charges should be dropped.\" Ioannidis also said he has presented evidence that will throw a different light on the events leading up to the pair\\'s sensational withdrawal from the Athens Games. The lawyer added that he has proof the authorities \"knew\" Kenteris was in Germany at the time he was alleged to have missed a test in Chicago. Nick Davies, spokesman for athletics\\' ruling body the IAAF, which handed out the provisional bans, said: \"We can\\'t comment because we were not present at the hearing and don\\'t know what was said behind closed doors. \"We expect a verdict from the Greek Athletics Federation before the end of February and will obviously be making a statement then.\" Kenteris won 200m gold at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, while Thanou won silver in the 100m.',\n",
